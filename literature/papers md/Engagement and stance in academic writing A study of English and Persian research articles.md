Abstract  Written texts of any kind embody some interactions between writers and their potential readers. This study focused on 
academic writing to find about  linguistic features used by  writers to create such interactions. Following Hyland’s (2005) model of 
interaction in which stance and engagement are introduced as two discoursal features having an effective role in constructing 
writer-reader interactions, this study aimed at investigating the ways in which English and Persian academics express their 
position to discover the strategies used to bring readers to their writing. To this end, 120 English and Persian research articles in 
two disciplines of Chemistry and Sociology were analyzed for the purposes of cross-linguistic and cross-disciplinary comparison. 
The results demonstrated that the writers of both disciplines, especially the sociologists, considered the expression of stance 
and engagement markers in their writing important. However, in sociology articles there was a greater effort to interact with 
readers. Further, in Persian there seemed to be more cases of readers’ involvement. 
 
Keywords: academic writing, discoursal features, stance,  engagement, disciplinary differences; 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Over the last decades, academic writing has undergone a great change such that it is no longer thought of as 
an objective, faceless and impersonal form of writing, rather it is considered as an endeavor on the part of 
writers aiming to initiate  some interaction with their readers (Hyland, 2005).  In other words, producing good 
academic writing demands not only writers’ linguistic ability but also their awareness of rhetorical features 
accepted by readers. Academic writing is, in fact, seen as transformation of knowledge, a process through 
which the writer brings the readers to an understanding of his work’s value and significance (Tarry, 2005).  
Academic writing is not just a linguistic process; it is a socio-political process  in which writers, as the owners 
of power, try to be acknowledged and recognized by the social community they write for (Casanave, 2003). 
To accomplish this task, writers employ different strategies to express their identity in writing.  
As Hyland (2010) puts it, we are really no more supposed to think of academic writing as completely 
‘author evacuated’, but instead, as  consisting of  exact evaluations and interactions (p.116). He, furthermore, 
refers to research articles as ‘sites’ where writers are not just offering their viewpoints, but also attempting to 
negotiate some relations with those who will possibly read these products. Looking at the issue from this 
perspective, Hyland (2010) leads us to the idea of interpersonality in academic writing, which is concerned 
with the ways through which writers make use of the explicit system of meanings to enter their ‘voice’ into the 
texts to be heard by their readers. To achieve this goal, writers should actually be well aware of the norms of 
the community they are writing for. 
Thus, like any other mode of communication, there is a textual interaction between the writer and 
readers in the process of academic writing. The theoretical foundation informing the explication of such a 
writer-reader interaction is Halliday’s (1978, 1985) classification of  three macro-functions of language: 
ideational, interpersonal, and textual. Based on this classification, Vande Kopple (1985) differentiates

between the ideational function, on the one hand, and the interpersonal and textual functions, on the other, 
with the former being achieved through primary discourse and the latter through  metadiscourse. According 
to Cheng and Steffensen (1996), interpersonal metadiscourse serves the function of developing writer- 
reader relationship.   
 
2. A Model of Interaction in Academic Writing  
    
Hyland (2005) has presented a working model to expound the  interaction between writers and readers. He 
maintains that the purpose of writing is not only producing some texts or explaining an external reality, but 
also constructing and negotiating social relations with the readers. According to this model, the interaction in 
academic writing mainly involves two major elements of stance and engagement.     
 
 
   
As can be seen in the figure above, writers attempt to project their position in the texts through the following 
elements: 
1. Hedges 
2. Boosters 
3. Attitude Markers 
4. Self- mention 
 
In addition to expressing their positions in what they write, writers are also required to bring the potential 
readers into their text. As Hyland (2005) explains, writers can involve the readers in their writing by making 
use of one or more of these five elements: 
1. Reader pronouns 
2. Personal Asides  
3. Appeals to shared knowledge 
4. Directives 
5. Questions  
 
 Over the past years, researchers have referred to the issue of stance using different names such as 
‘evaluation’ (Hunston, 1994; Hunston & Thompson, 2000), ‘intensity’ (Labov, 1984), ‘affect’ (Ochs, 1989), 
‘evidentiality’ (Chafe, 1986; Chafe & Nichols, 1986), ‘hedging’ (Holmes, 1988; Hyland, 1996a&b), and ‘stance’ 
(Barton, 1993; Beach & Anson, 1992; Biber & Finegan 1988, 1989; Biber, Johansson, Leech, & Conrad, 
1999; Conrad & Biber, 2000). Although researchers have used different names, they all have actually 
followed the same goal. They aimed to investigate the ways in which writers and speakers project their 
personal feelings and judgments in what they produce.

Considering the importance of acquiring the skill of writing a good abstract for journal articles, Phuong 
(2008) has analyzed the ‘rhetorical moves’ and ‘author’s stance’ in 30 abstracts of journal articles. Together 
with introducing five major moves present in the abstract section of these articles, Phuong (2008) provides a 
list of those linguistic features that help the authors indicate their ‘stance’ in their writing. Grammatical 
subjects, verb tenses and aspects, voice, modal auxiliaries and semi-modal verbs, self-reference words, 
attitudinal adjectives, reporting verbs are some items included in this list. 
Biber (2006) in a study of stance, as a discoursal element, examined university registers within both 
speech and writing. This study restricted itself just to grammatical features specifically adverbials and 
complement clauses aiming to come up with different ways of expression of stance by means of various 
grammatical features.  It was found that  adverbials express the attitude or assessment of the speaker or 
writer with respect to the proposition in the matrix clause while in the complement clauses, the matrix clause 
verbs express a stance with respect to the proposition in the complement clause. Finally, his findings confirm 
the view, held by previous studies, that stance should be necessarily expressed in all university registers. 
But, when it comes to the comparison between written and spoken registers, the study surprisingly suggests 
that the expression of stance in written registers is rare and more restricted in meaning than in their spoken 
counterparts.   Readers’ engagement, with its key role in shaping effective writing, has also been the focus of 
researchers’ attention in recent years.  As Hyland (2005) asserts academic research articles are interactive 
with the authors making their readers actively involved in the communication process.  Based on a framework 
of engagement which he has developed, Hyland (2005)  focused on a total corpus of 64 project reports 
written by a group of final-year Hong Kong undergraduates to explore the ways in which these participants try 
to show the readers’ presence in their writings so as to establish relationship with them.  Also, the researcher 
compared students’ products and professional academics’ practices to show how these writers’ purposes 
determine the construction of the readers in their works.  The findings of the study suggest that contrary to 
what is often depicted, academic writing is not an impersonal monologue, but it contains many dialogic 
interactions. Finally, distinguishing such engagement devices as reader pronouns, asides, and references to 
shared knowledge from directives and questions Hyland (2005) concludes that the former devices are used 
to draw on the shared goals between the writers and readers and, thereby to bring the reader into the 
discourse as a ‘fellow disciplinary member’. 
 
3. The Present Study 
 
Following Hyland's (2005) model of interaction, the present study has focused on a detailed analysis of 
linguistic features occurring in two different Persian academic disciplines to find out  to what extent they are 
similar to their English counterparts. To put it simply, this study aimed to investigate whether or not Persian 
and English academics make use of the same discoursal elements for creating interaction with their readers. 
Specifically, the following research questions were  addressed: 
1. Do Persian as well as English writers of Sociology and Chemistry articles make use of stance and 
engagement markers to interact with their readers?  
2. Do academic writing practices in two disciplines of Sociology and Chemistry show any differences in these 
two languages? 
 
4. Method 
 
4.1. Corpus  
 
A total number of 120 research articles from two broad fields of Chemistry and Sociology in two languages of 
Persian and English constituted the corpus of this study.  Chemistry and Sociology  were chosen as 
representatives of two different fields of Natural and Social Sciences. The idea was to study possible cross-

disciplinary differences in terms of writer-reader interactions in the domain of academic writing. For English 
articles, two leading international publications, SAGE, and SCIENCE DIRECT, with a quite large number of 
journals, were referred to. From among online journals existing in the fields of Chemistry and Sociology, 
European Polymer Journal, Arabian Journal of Chemistry, and Polymer together with journals of Sociology, 
Cultural Sociology, and Teaching Sociology were used as the source of research articles.  
 
As for the Persian language, data was collected from four Iranian journals: from Quarterly Journal of 
Communication Research and Quarterly Journal of Cultural Research 30 Persian research articles in the field 
of Sociology were selected and from Journal of Science and Polymer Technology and  Journal of SIAU 30 
Persian articles in the field of Chemistry were chosen (See Table 1).

As shown in Table 1, both Persian and English materials of the study were chosen from articles published 
recently and over a short period of time. Considering that research articles as academic genres would 
undergo changes through longer periods of time (Kim, 2009), this decision was made. 
 
Another issue of concern is the choice of the topics of research articles. The corpus of the study 
covered a variety of issues in both Sociology and Chemistry, and no specific topics were selected. This was 
based on the fact that the conventions of the register as some interpersonal aspects of the discourse are not 
directly influenced by the topics of the texts (Kim, 2009). 
 
 4.2. Procedure 
 
First, a list of potentially interactive markers in both Persian and English was prepared. In providing such a 
list, the researcher heavily relied on the previous research into interactive features (e.g. Biber & Finegan, 
1989; Hyland, 1999/ 2000; Hyland, 2005; Hyland, 2008; Lewin, 2005; Abdi, 2002; Kim, 2009). 
 
Regarding the text analysis of both English and Persian articles, one considerable point needs to be 
mentioned. Unlike some previous studies focusing their analysis on just one section of the articles like 
Brenton's (1996) study of conference abstracts or Swales' (1990) project on introductions in this study all 
parts of the articles were examined. As Hyland (2005) observes, just considering the happening of stance 
and engagement markers in just Introduction and Discussion as subjective and author-centered sections of 
the article seems unwise.  In the next stage, Wordsmith 2003, a text analysis and concordance program, was 
used to find the exact number of the occurrence of each item of stance and engagement markers in the 
articles based on the two lists produced in the previous section. 30% of the corpus was also double-checked 
by a scholar in the field to guarantee the reliability of the results. The results were found to have a correlation 
coefficient of 0.86 in the case of English and Persian articles of chemistry while this figure was 0.88 for their 
counterparts in the field of sociology. 
 
4.3. Data Analysis 
 
4.3.1. Stance Markers 
 
In the following sentences some examples of stance markers are presented to illustrate the interaction 
between the writer and readers. The examples show how academic writers make use of hedges in order to

manage their uncertainty towards a proposition in a text: 
 
English:  While it may still be used in art theory, it is almost absent in the human and social sciences.  
Persian: Shaayad zamaani een tafaavothaa ma’ni-ye xod raa az dast bedahand.(Maybe sometime these 
differences lose their meaning) 
 
On the contrary, the next following examples show how English and Persian writers, through boosters, create 
some opportunities to express both  their certainty in what they say and their solidarity with the audience:  
 
English: In short, whatever the quality of our article might have been, we certainly seemed to have touched a 
nerve. 
Persian: Qat’an modiraan-e raadio baraay-e bahregiree az een emkaanaat…..(Definitely, for the radio 
managers to exploit these opportunities………..  ) 
 
By incorporating into their writing some attitude markers carrying with themselves different meanings of 
surprise, agreement, importance, and frustration, academic writers make use of another discoursal element 
to show the stance they take towards some proposition. Also, by referring to some shared values, these 
writers attempt to bring their readers to an agreement with themselves. Consider these examples: 
  
English: It is to some extent surprising that someone who has been critical of the exclusive use of survey 
evidence in the sociology of stratification (Crompton, 2008) should now be so keen to endorse its centrality.  
Persian: az aanjaa ke motaesefaane barnaame saazaan-e raadio saalhaast……..(since unfortunately radio 
program developers for years……………..  
 
The technique of using first person pronouns and possessive adjectives, self-mention, is another device 
through which academics can project themselves in their texts. The following sentences will clarify the point: 
   
English: In order to functionalize the P1-core, we have followed the literature procedures   
Persian: Dar een pazhoohesh pazhooheshgar dar naqsh-e modeer talaash mikonad…….(In this study, the 
researcher as a manager is trying…………..)     
 
4.3.2. Engagement Markers 
 
 The first and, perhaps, the most explicit device through which writers can accompany the  readers in the 
process of writing and create a dialogue with them is  reader pronouns. Here are some examples to show 
how writers  give their audiences a sense of membership:   
 
English: Let us  take a well-known example: nowadays, no Anglo-American bibliography in our 
disciplines……… 
Persian: az een roo laazem ast be estefaadee az raveshhaay-e keifeetaree rooy aavarim taa een emkaan 
raa biyaabeem……(so it is necessary that we seek more qualitative approaches so that we can…..) 
 
Sometimes, writers make very brief interruptions to offer a comment on assertions they have made. These 
intentional interruptions are referred to as personal asides. 
 
English: Conversely, the variously bonded variants of ODPA give a rather complex signal pattern in mostly 
linear polymers (showing that all possibilities of reacting are probably used) whereas one group of signals 
(17, 19, 20)and thus one bonding form gets prominence under higher branching.

Persian: ……az sooye resaanehaay-e raqeeb naagozeer be estefaadeh az hameen resaanehaa baraaye 
afzayesh-e kaaraayee va moxaatab ast (ke xod no’ee forsat-e tallayee beshomaar miravad). ( due to the rival 
media there is no other choice but to use the same media to increase productivity and viewers (which is a 
golden opportunity itself) 
 
Presupposing that their potential readers share some certain values and ideas with them, writers of academic 
texts make use of some explicit markers to focus their readers’ attention on those shared knowledge, and 
thereby bring them to an agreement with themselves (see examples 1 through 3, for more clarification):  
 
English: We know the structuralist trend of the 1960s, developed by the anthropologist Lévi-Strauss, the 
psychoanalyst Lacan, the philosopher Foucault….. 
Persian: sargozasht-e keshvar-e zhaapon shaayad mesaal-e xoobee baashad. Hamegaan baavar daarand 
zhaapon ke emrooz-e be yekee az keshvarhaaye…..(the history of Japan is a good example. People all 
believe that Japan today is one of the countries……..) 
  
When possible, academic writers take the role of a teacher to give their readers some instructions enabling 
them to perform an action in the way they suggest. Through such directives, writers invite their audiences to 
either refer to some other part in the same article or take some moments thinking about what they are asked 
so as to finally come up with a certain outcome:  
 
English: Consider, for instance, why you are turning the pages of this book at all – why you have decided to 
study sociology. . . 
Persian: tavajoh daashte baasheed ke besyaari az film haay-e toleed shod-e……(be aware that most movies 
produced…..)  
   
Academics can also think of  questions so as to both arouse their audiences’ curiosity and encourage them to 
follow the argument to the end: 
 
English: Should the sociologist focus on ‘major’ arts, because they are considered as such by the actors and 
as a result of such perceptions play important roles in society? 
Persian: Aayaa resaanehaa baa modiriyat-e bohraan hamraah xaahand shod? (Will the media accompany 
the management of crisis?)  
 
5. Results  
 
The analysis of 120 research articles demonstrated that the expression of stance and engagement features 
was of great importance in academic writing, with 110 occurrences in each English sociology article, 23 
cases in each English chemistry article, 112 ones in each Persian sociology article, and finally 32 
occurrences in each Persian chemistry article. Put differently, there was one case in every 37 words in 
English sociology articles; one in every125 words in English chemistry papers; one in every 35 words in 
Persian sociology articles and one in every 94 words in Persian chemistry papers. 
Considering this outcome, the present study is in line with findings of the previous projects on the issue 
(e.g. Hyland, 2005a; Hyland, 2005b; Abdi, 2002; Hyland, 2010), all emphasizing the inclusion of stance and 
engagement markers in research articles of different academic fields of study. 
As long as the comparison between the two disciplines is concerned, in both languages, the Sociology 
rather than Chemistry academics were found to attempt more to interact with their potential readers by 
including a greater number of stance and engagement markers mostly through  hedges and attitude markers 
(see Table 2). This is due to the fact that, as Abdi (2002), Hyland (2005), and Hyland (2010) observe, in

producing writing of social sciences, writers have more freedom to accompany the texts with their personal 
feelings and emotions than in natural sciences where the writers are only reporting some scientific facts.

Among the nine elements under the study, hedge was found as the most frequently occurring item in all 
English articles, especially Sociology, which is in line with the findings of Bank (1994), Mayer (1994) and  
Lewin (2005). This outcome reflects the necessity of distinguishing facts from opinions in social sciences on 
the part of English academics when talking about their achieved outcome. Regarding this element, we can 
refer to Abdi’s (2002) study of interpersonal metadiscourse in which he found writers of social rather than 
natural sciences to make use of hedges more frequently. The fewer occurrences of hedges in Chemistry 
articles can be justified considering the nature of natural academic writing which allows more certainty on the 
part of writers reporting some empirical phenomena. However,  in Persian, attitude markers were found to be 
employed most frequently in both Chemistry and Sociology with the latter showing a greater frequency. 
        Regarding other stance and engagement markers, no case of questions and shared knowledge was 
found in both English and Persian Chemistry articles, while Sociology academics made use of, at least, a few 
number of these engagement features.  Academics of both fields of study, however, did not show 
considerable differences in their use of directives, and sociologists used only a few cases of such 
engagement devices in their articles. It should be mentioned that, generally, the frequency of directives was 
not that great in the whole corpus of the study. 
Also, writers of both fields of study were found to employ almost an equal number of boosters, as 
another stance marker, in their articles. Finally, as for personal asides  both fields of study showed a very 
close number of occurrences in the research articles (see Table 2). 
With regard to the total number of occurrences of both stance and engagement markers in the English 
and Persian articles of Sociology and Chemistry (see Table 2), it can be concluded that in the field of 
Chemistry, Persian academics’ use of interactive features (10.2) overwhelms their English counterparts’ 
(7.5), while in Sociology writings, the two groups of writers were found to attempt almost equally in order to 
interact with their readers (26.6 in Persian and 27.5 in English). 
As for cross-linguistic comparison, in the case of reader pronouns and self-mentions English and

Persian languages showed some differences. For the purpose of involving the readers in their writing, unlike 
English writers who confined themselves to the use of subject and object pronouns together with possessive 
adjectives, Persian academics were found to show their commitment with the readers through both reader 
pronouns and verb inflections. Self-mentions, as a stance marker, were not found to be used in the Persian 
articles in the same way as their English counterparts. While English writers’ mention of themselves was 
through their use of first person pronouns (subject or object) and sometimes possessive adjectives, Persian 
academics were found to talk about themselves only in few cases and through words with the meaning of ‘the 
researcher’. However, all in all, confirming findings of the previous studies (Hyland, 2002; Kuo, 1999; Tang & 
John, 1999), here English academics of both fields of study were found to consider the use of self- mentions 
important. This difference indicates that unlike English writers aiming to make an argument stronger through 
their use of first person pronouns, Persian academics seek to highlight the phenomena under discussion 
rather than themselves.  
In order to see whether the two disciplines or the two languages were different in terms of stance and 
engagement and whether the difference was significant, the Chi-square was employed. Tables 3 through 6 
show the results:

As shown in Table 3, the Chi-square (2= .222) is not statistically significant( p=0.637) which indicates that 
English and Iranian academics’ writing practices are not different from each other in the field of Chemistry.

As Table 6 shows, in the case of Persian corpus, academic writers also were found to show significant 
differences when writing research articles in two fields of Sociology and Chemistry (2=8.52, p=.004). All in 
all, in both languages, it was the sociologists who made a greater use of interactive features in their 
academic writing.  In sum, according to Table 7, in all cases reported, stance markers show a greater 
percentage of occurrence (89.2% as the highest in Persian Chemistry articles) as compared with 
engagement markers which have their highest figure of 29.7% in English Sociology articles.

Table7. Stance and Engagement Frequency of Occurrences in English and Persian Academic Writing 
(Chemistry and Sociology) 
 
 
6. Discussion and Conclusions 
 
The results of the study, as related to the use of engagement and stance markers in English and Persian in 
both Chemistry and Sociology, are in line with findings of the previous projects on the issue (Hyland, 2005a; 
Hyland, 2005b; Abdi, 2002; Hyland, 2010). The results show the importance of stance and engagement 
expressions in academic writings. The importance of including these interaction markers, in comparison with 
other common discoursal features, is well understood, especially when we look at Biber et al.’s (1999) in 
which   passive voice constructions were reported to be used less frequently than stance and engagement 
markers.  
In line with Hyland’s (2005) model of interaction, it was also observed that stance markers occurred five 
times more frequently than engagement markers. Both Sociology and Chemistry articles in the two 
languages have shown greater frequency of stance rather than engagement features. 
  As for cross-linguistic differences, among the nine elements under the study, hedges were found as 
the most frequently occurring item (similar to Bank, 1994; Salager-Mayer, 1994; and Lewin, 2005) in all 
English articles, especially Sociology. This outcome reflects the necessity of distinguishing facts from opinion 
on the part of English academics when discussing their achieved outcome. Regarding this element, we can 
refer to Abdi’s (2002) study of interpersonal metadiscourse, in which he found writers of Social rather than 
Natural sciences to make use of hedges more frequently. This fewer occurrences of hedges in Chemistry 
articles can be justified considering the nature of natural academic writing which allows more certainty on the 
part of writers reporting some empirical phenomena.  
In the Persian research articles again  stance markers, but this time attitude marker, were found to 
show themselves most of all, suggesting that Persian academic writers let a great deal of feeling (emotion, 
surprise, importance, frustration, etc) in their writing.  
 
Another interesting outcome is the case of reader pronouns, as an engagement feature, for which 
English and Persian languages showed some differences. Unlike English which confines its references to the 
subject and object pronouns together with possessive adjectives, the Persian language makes it possible for 
its users to show their committeemen with the readers through verb inflections. It should be mentioned that

regarding references in the English corpus, the present study found the highest frequency in the case of 
inclusive pronouns we and our rather than you and your. This finding is also in line with Hyland’s (2005) study 
which reports the appearance of You pronouns only in philosophy but We in almost all other fields of study.   
The results related to self-mentions, as a stance marker, as reported above suggest that unlike English 
writers aiming to make an argument stronger through their use of first person pronouns, Persian academics 
seek to highlight the phenomena under discussion rather than themselves. However, all in all, confirming 
findings of the previous studies(Hyland, 2002; Kuo, 1999; Tang & John, 1999), here English academics of 
both fields of study were found to consider the use of self- mentions as an important stance marker. 
  As for cross-disciplinary comparison, in both languages it was the Sociology rather than Chemistry 
academics that attempted more to interact with their potential readers by including a greater number of 
stance and engagement markers. This is due to the fact that as Abdi (2002), Hyland (2005), and Hyland 
(2010) maintain, in Social sciences writers have more freedom to incorporate into the texts their personal 
feelings and emotions than in Natural sciences in which its writers are only reporting some scientific facts.   
The findings of the study can help the Persian academic writers who need to publish their articles in 
English journals. Being aware of similarities and differences between English and Persian research articles, 
Persian academic writers would produce better articles which meet the standards of English journals. This 
implication of the study reminds us of Kaplan’s(1987) belief that foreign students of a language are required 
to form standards of judgment according to the system of a target language.
