Academic writing not only conveys academic content but also represents the
authorial identity, serving as a means of presenting one’s identity. Writers utilize
various linguistic resources to present different possibilities of self, such as
intertextuality, thereby constructing their authorial identity. This study examines
the Chinese EFL learners’ construction of authorial identity in academic writing
from an intertextuality perspective. This study adopts a mixed method, utilizing
interviews and written texts as data sources. Results were found that novice
writers primarily construct their identities through the practices of direct
intertextuality during the initial stages of identity construction. As novice
writers gain more experience through extensive reading and writing practices,
as well as academic writing courses, their intertextuality practices undergo
a transformation. They begin to shift from direct intertextuality to indirect
intertextuality, aiming to express their own conceptions, attempting to be like
a “scholar” through indirect intertextuality. The study highlights the importance
of intertextuality in the construction of academic writing identity for EFL learners.
By understanding the interplay between intertextuality and authorial identity,
educators can better assist EFL learners in achieving success in their academic
writing endeavors.

1 Introduction
Authorial identity is an essential rhetorical device in academic writing. Academic
writing serves as a critical space for constructing authorial identity, and the two are closely
intertwined (Li and Deng, 2019). Appropriately establishing authorial identity can assist
writers in expressing their viewpoints and making their academic research more accessible
to readers. Therefore, the construction of authorial identity is necessary in academic writing
(Hyland, 2002a,b; Çandarli et al., 2015). The construction of authorial identity in academic
writing is a complex and multifaceted process that plays a crucial role in the academic
success of EFL learners (Ouyang and Tang, 2006; Hyland, 2013; Swales, 2014; Fang, 2018a).

This process becomes even more intricate when considering the
speciﬁc context of Chinese EFL learners1, who often encounter
challenges in adapting to the conventions and expectations of
academic writing such as patch-writing, plagiarism, and how to use
the literature sources to support their own opinions. Intertextuality
encompasses the use of existing texts, such as scholarly articles,
textbooks, and other academic sources, to inform and support
one’s own arguments and ideas (Pecorari et al., 2012; Pecorari
and Shaw, 2012). Intertextuality refers to the relationship between
texts and how they inﬂuence the creation and interpretation of
meaning (Weigle and Montee, 2012; Plakans and Gebril, 2013).
Understanding and utilizing intertextuality eﬀectively is crucial for
establishing academic credibility and demonstrating the capacity to
engage with scholarly discourse (Bazerman, 2004; Holmes, 2004).
Swales (2004) claims that “we are all admitted intertextualists
now, both in theory and in practice” (p. 21), but while the notion
of intertextuality seems well established among analysts (Bremner,
2008), there is less speciﬁc discussion of it in relation to authorial
identity in academic writing. For Chinese EFL learners, they
often face signiﬁcant challenge in navigating intertextuality due to
linguistic and cultural diﬀerences. Therefore, this study employs
a mixed-method to explore how Chinese EFL learners negotiate
and construct their authorial identity in academic writing through
intertextuality.
2 Literature review
2.1 Theoretical underpinnings
Ivaniˇc (1998) proposed a multidimensional theory of authorial
identity based on case studies of British learners, which made
signiﬁcant contributions to the theory and practice of writing.
Her research placed the author back at the center of the writing
process and deepened our understanding of the relationship
between the nature of academic discourse and the author’s
identity. Ivaniˇc (1994, 1995, 1998) gradually developed a clear and
comprehensive framework of authorial identity, consisting of four
interrelated aspects: (1) the autobiographical self, which includes
the knowledge, experience, values, and beliefs that the author brings
to the writing process; (2) the discoursal self, which is the self-image
shaped by the author’s use of language resources; (3) the self as
an author, which encompasses the author’s expressed viewpoints
and positions; and (4) the various possibilities for the self in social,
cultural, and institutional environments, including the language
resources needed to construct the self. These four aspects are
interwoven to form the concept of the author’s self.
Burgess and Ivaniˇc (2010) improved Ivaniˇc’s framework by
adding a new aspect, the perceived writer, which refers to the
reader’s expectations and inﬂuence on the author, as well as the
impression formed by the reader through interaction with the
text. Ivaniˇc (2005) argued that the authorial identity only exists
1
English as a Foreign Language, or learning and using English as an
additional language in a non-English speaking country. China has the largest
number of EFL learners/users in the world (Wei and Su, 2012; Wang and Wei,
2023) and the number of it still be on the rise (Wei and Su, 2015; Wei and
Gao, 2022).
in a “vacuum” before the reader reads the text, and the author’s
identity is constructed in the text only after the reader forms
an impression. Matsuda (2001) deﬁned the authorial identity
in discourse as the “composite eﬀect of people’s conscious or
unconscious choices of language and non-language resources that
exist and constantly change in society” (p. 40), emphasizing that
authorial identity construction is a dynamic eﬀect rather than a
static characteristic. To fully understand identity, it is necessary
to consider the interaction between the text, author, reader, and
context (Matsuda, 2015).
In order to reﬂect the dynamic, situational, interactive, and
complex nature of authorial identity construction, this study
further reﬁnes the framework based on Burgess and Ivaniˇc’s
(2010) model and Canagarajah’s (2015) division of authorial
identity into “extra-textual identity” and “textual identity,” while
incorporating the contextual factors. The reﬁned framework
consists of three parts: textual identity, extra-textual identity, and
contextual identity. Textual identity primarily relies on the text
itself, encompassing the discoursal self and the self as an author.
Extra-textual identity originates from the autobiographical self
and the perceived writer. Contextual identity has two dimensions:
macro and micro environments. This framework facilitates the
analysis of language features in authorial identity construction
within the text, the interaction between individual and social factors
in diﬀerent contexts outside the text, and the interplay between text,
author, and reader (see Figure 1).
2.2 The conception of authorial identity
Research on authorial identity is mainly based on the
perspectives of expressionism and social constructionism, dialog
philosophy, and social interaction theory (Bizzell, 1992; Burgess
and Ivaniˇc, 1998, 2010; Ivaniˇc, 1998, 2005; Norton, 2000,
2012; Hyland, 2005; Coﬃn and Donohue, 2012; Zhao, 2013).
Expressionism uses the concept of “voice” to represent the personal
imprint left by the author in the text (Yu and Cao, 2015), and
regards authorial identity as the individual’s self-expression in
discourse writing, which is deeply rooted in the individualistic
concept of mainstream Western culture (Hyland, 2005). The social
constructionism perspective uses the concept of “self” and “self-
promotion” to reﬂect the authorial identity in academic texts,
and regards it as socially and culturally constructed. Individuals
constantly create, change, and perceive their internal and external
identities based on speciﬁc language, discourse, and cultural
conventions (Bizzell, 1992; Norton, 2000, 2012). Expressionism
focuses too much on the individual voice and self-expression in
identity, while social constructionism emphasizes that authorial
identity is constructed in a social and cultural context, emphasizing
its social nature. Therefore, the expressionism and constructionism
perspectives on authorial identity have led to a binary opposition,
dividing the individuality and sociability of identity. To eliminate
this binary opposition, Prior (2001) proposes the perspective of
dialog philosophy, which regards identity as having both individual
and social attributes. Social interaction theory further elaborates on
identity based on the above theoretical perspectives, emphasizing
that identity is not just a personal, internal, static “state or fact”
(p. 58), but is constantly developing and changing in social

interaction (Ivaniˇc, 1998, 2005; Burgess and Ivaniˇc, 2010). Thus, the
perspective of authorial identity shifts toward social and cultural
construction.
Currently, most research on authorial identity focuses on the
factors that inﬂuence authorial identity construction, the authorial
identity construction characteristics based on discourse analysis,
the authorial identity practice process with the author as the
emic, and the exploration of the eﬀects of authorial identity
construction from the reader’s perspective (Beason, 2001; Matsuda
and Tardy, 2007; Tardy and Matsuda, 2009; Tardy, 2012, 2016;
Matsuda, 2015), The factors that inﬂuence authorial identity mainly
include the beliefs and attitudes of the author toward authorial
identity. Exploring the relationship between writing beliefs and
authorial identity has positive implications for writing instruction
and student learning (Tang and Xu, 2015). These studies mainly
use survey, questionnaires and comparative research to explore the
inﬂuence of writing beliefs or attitudes on authorial identity, and
have found that beliefs or attitudes aﬀect their writing identity,
including intentional or unintentional plagiarism (Hofer et al.,
1998; Pajares, 2003; Sommers and Saltz, 2004; Pittam et al.,
2009; Elander et al., 2010; Ballantine and Larres, 2012; Kinder
and Elander, 2012; Çandarli et al., 2015). Based on discourse
analysis, authorial identity construction characteristics are analyzed
using discourse analysis or corpus, exploring the commonalities
and individual of identity construction in a speciﬁc discourse
community (Wu and Rubin, 2000; Hood, 2004, 2012; Hyland,
2005, 2008, 2012; De Costa, 2007; Xu, 2013, 2015; Çandarli et al.,
2015). The above studies illustrate the similarities and diﬀerences
in how diﬀerent authors use language resources to construct
authorial identity, as well as the diﬀerences in language culture
and disciplines when constructing identity. Discourse analysis or
corpus comparative research describes language facts based on a
large amount of data, and the research results are more scientiﬁc,
revealing the overall trend of second language academic authorial
identity construction for learners from the perspective of text
features. However, it is easy to overlook the focus on the individual
author, the inﬂuence of factors such as interaction and negotiation
involved in text identity construction, and the communicative
eﬀects in real contexts. Research on authorial identity practice
process with the author as the subject mainly uses an emic
perspective, focusing on the construction of authorial identity
by second/foreign language writers through ethnographic case
tracking, in-depth interviews, verbal thinking, or autobiographical
narratives, and tracking and describing how they construct identity
and develop in speciﬁc writing contexts, discovering the factors
and writing behaviors involved in authorial identity construction
(Matsuda, 2001; Starﬁeld, 2002; Quellette, 2008; Cox, 2010; Deng,
2012; Langum and Sullivan, 2017). These studies reﬂect the
dynamic, diverse, interactive, and negotiated nature of authorial
identity construction by recording and analyzing the development
and changes in writing ability of individual authors in the writing
process, but they focus too much on the individual characteristics
of the author, and may overlook the text characteristics. Exploring
the eﬀects of authorial identity construction from the reader’s
perspective mainly uses survey and interview research methods.
Readers infer the process and methods of authorial identity
construction and which factors aﬀect their evaluation of authorial
identity through the author’s text (Chang, 2018). This perspective is
a relatively novel research method and can prove that target readers
can experience the author’s constructed identity in academic
discourse text. Overall, the construction of authorial identity
mainly focuses on one aspect, such as text, individual authors,
or the reader’s perspective. Therefore, this study both from the
written text and authors to conduct an in-depth exploration of
the interactivity, complexity, and situationality of authorial identity
construction.
2.3 Intertextuality on second language
writing
Intertextuality is one of the important foundations of writing
research and practice (Hyland, 2009). Writing and reading are seen
as a creative process of forming new texts through intertextuality
Frontiers in Psychology

(Holmes, 2004). The writing process is dynamic, dialogic, and
involves many activities related to constructing text, including
planning, responding, and referencing other documents, using
organizational templates and conventions, and collaborating, all of
which involve other text production (Bremner, 2008). Speciﬁcally,
constructing the writing process is a continuous and dynamic
dialogic process between multiple texts, and many aspects of this
process rely more or less on other texts. That is to say, the
birth of a new text is often a response to previous texts or the
current context. It is not a closed text, but an open body that
incorporates countless other texts in the process of construction
(ibid). In the process of writing, authors often borrow from other
texts (including previous texts, source texts, or examples in the
same language category) to serve their own writing (Kristeva,
1986; Fairclough, 1992). Authors need to build new knowledge and
new perspectives on the basis of previous research. For example,
authors comb through scientiﬁc achievements in a research ﬁeld to
add rationality and necessity to their own research (Chen, 2017).
At the same time, when authors read previous texts as readers,
they often add their own voice and read out their own meaning,
creatively producing an abstract intertext by further interpreting
the source text (Bazerman, 2004). An intertext is not only a text with
intertextuality characteristics, but should be formed jointly by the
inherent schematic text in the human brain and external texts (Hu,
2014). The reading that authors do before or during the writing
process is constantly constructing a part of the intertext, refreshing
the meaning of this intertext. It can be said that the process of
authors reading previous texts is a process of absorbing, criticizing
the ideas and viewpoints of predecessors, and stimulating self-
thinking and seeking writing inspiration. Therefore, intertextuality
is not just a matter of which other texts authors refer to, but how
authors use them, what authors use them for, and ultimately how
authors position themself as a writer to them to make their own
statement (Bazerman, 2004). It is a signiﬁcant feature of academic
writing (Pecorari and Shaw, 2012) and is the basic means for
authors to use resources eﬀectively and correctly. The application
of intertextuality by authors is a basic ability they must possess
(Ma and Qin, 2015). Intertextuality shows the relationship between
two or more texts, and the development of intertextuality ability
is closely related to the development of writing ability, running
through the entire writing process (WynhoﬀOlsen et al., 2018).
In academic writing, intertextuality is more prominent because
it borrows and integrates various forms of texts to a greater
extent, bringing together various perspectives and voices, and
also showing various intertextuality relationships between text and
literature resources, such as veriﬁcation, correlation, comparison,
and application (Thompson and Tribble, 2001; Polio and Shi,
2012).
2.4 Intertextuality and authorial identity
Social construction of identity requires “building materials”
(Ivaniˇc, 1998, p. 47), learners draw on them, in socially constrained
ways, in the process of “construction.” As many theorists argue,
the most important of these “building materials” is language. Based
on the understanding that a person’s identity is constructed by
the language learners use, intertextuality is a central concept for
language and identity. Ivaniˇc (1998) pointed out that writing is
an identity behavior, and people realize various self-possibilities
formed by social and cultural factors in writing. The identity of
a writer includes two aspects: the writer’s identity when writing,
and the identity constructed by the writer in writing. The former
refers to the identity negotiated and constructed by the writer
through language resources in the text, which is inﬂuenced by
speciﬁc communicative situations, for instance, writers’ “own”
writing is not something original, but a “rich stew” of the writing
with they’re familiar (ibid, p. 85). The latter refers to the writer’s
identity in real life, which is also the identity brought to the
writing scene, inﬂuenced by social and cultural environment and
the writer’s background and experiences. In writing activities, what
the writer presents is not only the writer’s own voice, but also
the product of dialog and communication with diﬀerent voices
(Yu and Zhang, 2021). Intertextuality analysis in writing can
achieve multiple purposes, such as determining the main external
resources that the author relies on, how to use these resources,
and how to describe, base, and promote existing achievements
in related ﬁelds (Bazerman, 2004). In writing, there are many
writing strategies that help to construct the writer’s identity, and
intertextuality is an important one. Appropriate intertextuality
can help the author express both their own voice and external
voices, and achieve interaction with previous researchers and
potential readers. Therefore, intertextuality contributes to writer
identity in two ways. A writer’s identity is not individual and
new, but constituted by the writing she/he adopts. On the
other hand, a authorial identity is determined not completely
by other discourses, but rather by the unique way in which
she/he draws on and combines them. However, scholars have paid
less attention to the role of intertextuality in constructing the
authorial identity, and Chinese EFL learners have long faced the
problem of identity loss in academic writing (Zhao and Llosa,
2008). Intertextuality is an inherent mechanism in text generation
and comprehension, expressing the relationship between speciﬁc
texts, and the understanding of a particular text depends on the
understanding of the surrounding texts (WynhoﬀOlsen et al.,
2018). Speciﬁcally, language users reconstruct meaning through
absorption, internalization, transformation, and response between
texts in the process of text generation. Through intertextuality,
it can help to understand how writers eﬀectively choose and use
language resources, express their thoughts and construct their
selves in writing, and achieve interaction with previous researchers
and potential readers.
For a long time, English programs in non-English speaking
countries have often focused on training language proﬁciency while
neglecting the cultivation of critical thinking abilities (Fang, 2018b;
Li and Liu, 2018). The curriculum design of English programs
still primarily revolves around listening, speaking, reading, writing,
and translation, with language skill training remaining at the core
of English education. As a result, the development of critical
thinking abilities among second language learners is signiﬁcantly
constrained, leading to a general lack of training in critical
thinking skills. Wang (2020) notes that professional thinking is
a speciﬁc mode of thinking formed on the basis of professional
theories and practices, which involves building a dialog with
existing research results. Professional thinking is a type of educated
thinking, and its simplest and most direct criterion is intertextuality
competence. Intertextuality competence is one of the important

foundations of writing research and practice, and writing and
reading are highly intertextuality processes. Academic writing
is a social interactive practice that requires writers to engage
in a “dialog and intertextuality” with their own voice and the
voices of others (Swales, 2014, p. 40), addressing the tension
between individual innovation and disciplinary conventions,
values, knowledge positions, and linguistic forms to construct a
“recognizable” authoritative identity and a unique voice (Morton
and Storch, 2019, p. 15). Exploring how to handle dialog in
reading discourse, understanding and articulating topics, and
examining intertextuality as a reading and writing practice hold
signiﬁcant importance for EFL learners in constructing their voices,
especially their academic voices. Therefore, it is of great practical
signiﬁcance to explore the academic voice of EFL learners in
academic writing from an intertextuality perspective. This study
takes the construction of Chinese EFL learners’ authorial identity
as the starting point and explores, through a case study from
the perspective of intertextuality, what kind of intertextuality is
presented by EFL learners in academic writing situations, and how
they construct their authorial identity through intertextuality. More
speciﬁcally, it sought to answer the following questions:
1. What kind of intertextuality are visible in academic writing of
Chinese EFL learners?
2. How do Chinese EFL learners construct their authorial
identity through intertextuality in academic writing?
3 Materials and methods
3.1 Research design
The aim of this study is to explore how Chinese EFL
learners construct their authorial identity through intertextuality
in reading and writing practice. A concurrent triangulation design,
using mixed methods (Johnson et al., 2007), was employed to
collect quantitative and qualitative data simultaneously, and to
validate and synthesize corresponding research results (Creswell
and Creswell, 2018).
Concurrent triangulation design is a mixed methods research
design where the researcher collects both quantitative and
qualitative data at the same time during a roughly equivalent
period. The two forms of data are then analyzed separately
and the results are combined in the interpretation or ﬁndings.
Because both forms of data are collected concurrently, it is
typically considered a single-phase study where both forms of
data are given equal weight (Creswell and Creswell, 2018). As a
typical mixed methods research design, concurrent triangulation
requires the researcher to collect and analyze qualitative and
quantitative data on the research phenomenon using diﬀerent
but complementary data to better answer the research question.
In this design, quantitative and qualitative research are given
equal status and “integration” typically occurs at two stages:
(1) during data analysis, where data transformation is used
to convert data into the same type, and then combined for
analysis. For example, qualitative data can be coded or analyzed
using typology, and then combined with quantitative data for
statistical analysis; or quantitative data can be analyzed using
factor analysis to form a typology framework that becomes an
important dimension of qualitative data analysis. (2) During
data interpretation, by comparing the results of quantitative
and qualitative data analysis, the convergence, correlation, or
opposition of the conclusions are presented and further explained.
“Integration” can achieve triangulation or reveal conﬂicts in the
conclusions, leading to reconstruction of the research question
and design. The purpose of concurrent triangulation design is
to understand the same structure of the research from the
perspectives of two diﬀerent types of evidence. As an independent
methodology, mixed methods research integrates quantitative
and qualitative research, providing rich methodological choices,
opportunities for collision of research data and thinking, and
an important path to improve the quality of mixed methods
research in educational research (Li and Wang, 2016). Using
both quantitative and qualitative methods in the same research
project can explore research questions simultaneously at diﬀerent
levels and angles, and the diﬀerent methods can complement
each other to reveal diﬀerent aspects of the research phenomenon
(Chen, 2000). At the same time, it can test the correlation of
research results, thereby improving the reliability of research results
(Fielding and Fielding, 1986).
3.2 Research context
The research context of this study is a one-semester academic
writing course for second-year undergraduate students in a foreign
language program at one Chinese foreign studies university. The
course “academic writing” aims to cultivate mastery of academic
writing norms and genre knowledge in English majors, and
includes multiple writing activities. During the course, the teacher
provides students with diversity learning and reading resources,
containing major classic literature, research methodology literature,
and writing skills related to the subject ﬁeld (relate to linguistics). In
addition, students are required to read a large amount of literature
based on their own research and ﬁll out a progress report based on
the topic provided by the teacher, in order to complete the academic
paper for the course. The course design, writing tasks and activities,
and learning and reading resources provide students with abundant
textual resources for academic writing and research.
3.3 Participants
The two participants in this study are all second-year
undergraduate students from the English college of one Chinese
foreign university. They have all passed the Chinese English Test
Four (hereafter CET 4) proﬁciency exam. In March 2022, with
permission from their instructor of the academic writing course,
the researcher entered the course as a teaching assistant and
established daily contact with 14 students in the course through
the university’s online platform and WeChat. Using a combination
of purposive and convenience sampling methods (Yin, 2014), the
researcher initially selected four learners as participants. In the
early stages of the study, the researcher established close contact
and communication with these four participants. In the fourth

week, after an individual meeting with each of them, explaining
the purpose of the research, the researcher formally invited and
provided the research informed consent form to the four learners.
Two of them declined the invitation due to time and course-related
reasons and two of them agreed to participate (see Table 1). They
are hereafter referred to as Xiao xi and Xiao dong (pseudonyms).
Throughout the entire research process, this study adhered to
academic research ethics and made eﬀorts to do the following. First,
before collecting data, the researcher clearly informed the research
subject of the research purpose and process, such as the number
of interviews and required data format, allowing the participants
to fully understand the purpose and process of the study. Second,
the researcher communicated with the participants in advance,
conducting interviews only with the consent of the research
participants and recording with their permission. The researcher
also respected the time of participants and communicated with
them about the study when time allowed. Finally, during the report
writing process, this study adhered to academic ethics, did not
fabricate data, and did not plagiarize the academic achievements
of other researchers (Chen, 2000).
3.4 Data collection
Multiple data collection such as classroom observations,
interviews, digital video and audio recordings, and written artifacts,
including students’ in-process ﬁrst and ﬁnal products and teacher-
provided reading materials (see Table 2) were collected and ensured
the credibility of the data through triangulation, participant
validation, and peer debrieﬁng (Creswell and Creswell, 2018).
3.4.1 Classroom observation
Observation is one of the most basic methods for humans
to understand the surrounding world. It involves systematically
recording people, events, behaviors, settings, artifacts, and daily
activities (Marshall and Rossman, 2016). In case study research,
observation provides detailed descriptions of events, activities,
and situations that occur in speciﬁc contexts (Leavy, 2014).
Therefore, observation is also one of the main ways to collect
data in qualitative research. In this study, observation includes
three forms: classroom observation, teacher-student interaction
observation, and after-class academic writing practice observation.
Classroom observation, in particular, helps researchers understand
the social and cultural backgrounds of language users and
collect language-related data (Yin, 2018). In this study, classroom
observation focuses on two aspects. Firstly, it centers on academic
writing courses, paying attention to the teaching arrangements
and practical activities related to writing. Secondly, it focuses
on students, observing the learning process, class participation,
interactions with teachers, and collaboration with peers in
delivering subject speeches for the two participants.
3.4.2 Semi-structured interviews
The two participants were invited to participate in semi-
structured individual interviews to elicit their writing experience,
intertextuality use, process of writing assignments, and evaluation
criteria for writing. All the interviews were audio recorded with the
consent of the participants and conducted in English.
3.4.3 Written artifacts
To keep track of participants’ academic writing-related
intertextuality before and after writing the ﬁrst and ﬁnal drafts,
written artifacts in this research are also important data sources.
The writing texts mainly include three stages. The ﬁrst stage is
the topic selection stage, which includes the topic selection logs
completed by the participants on a weekly basis. The second stage
is the research design stage, which includes six descriptive and
evaluative essays (a total of 36 essays), a literature review in the ﬁrst
and second drafts, a research design in the ﬁrst and second drafts,
data analysis and discussion in the ﬁrst and second drafts, and a
research proposal Each section of the writing helps to systematically
and comprehensively explore the writer’s identity in participants’
academic writing. The third stage is the writing of the course paper,
which includes a ﬁrst and ﬁnal draft.
3.5 Data analysis
3.5.1 Quantitative analysis
Following the concurrent triangulation design (Creswell and
Creswell, 2018), this study collected both quantitative and
qualitative data. The quantitative analysis method primarily
quantitatively analyzed the types of intertextuality practices of
participants’ written artifacts. The types of intertextuality practices
were coded using the intertextuality strategy coding method
proposed by Ma and Qin (2015) (see Figure 2).
Integrating
the
analytical
framework
of
intertextuality
strategies proposed by Bazerman (2004), Pecorari and Shaw (2012),
and Ma and Qin (2015), it is worth noting that Bazerman (2004)
lacks analysis on implicit intertextuality in academic discourse.
Moreover, Ma and Qin (2015) provide a more detailed classiﬁcation
of the conventional and non-conventional intertextuality practices
proposed by Pecorari and Shaw (2012). The coding examples of
intertextuality practices is followed (see Table 3). We performed
the peer debrieﬁng (Lincoln and Guba, 1985; Creswell, 1994), a
strategy to ensure data analysis credibility and trustworthiness.
Speciﬁc speaking, all the writings were reviewed and rated by the
researcher and two post-graduate students who were invited to
read and check the coding schemes of intertextuality practices.
Each of us independently identiﬁed and coded the intertextuality
practices. Then we gathered to examine ﬁndings and resolved
disagreements after further discussion.
3.5.2 Qualitative analysis
The recorded audio data were transcribed by the ﬁrst author.
After transcription, the second author read and performed the
member checking (Creswell and Creswell, 2018) to ensure the
credibility and trustworthiness of all the interview data proﬁles
for the study. Following Huberman and Miles’s (1994) procedures,
each participant’s data were ﬁrst summarized and coded manually
to the framework and deﬁnition of authorial identity construction
proposed by Burgess and Ivaniˇc (2010). Themes and trends
in intertextuality were then identiﬁed in categories, and the
category set was reorganized accordingly. Revision of the categories
and recording of the data was repeated until a satisfactory
framework was proposed to explain the data. During this analysis
process, participants’ intertextuality both in textual and extra-
text conducted authorial identity was identiﬁed, described, and

4 Findings and discussion
4.1 Findings and discussion for RQ1:
types of intertextuality practice
From the written texts of the Xiao xi and Xiao dong’s ﬁrst
and ﬁnal draft of academic writing (see Tables 4, 5), it can be
seen that the intertextuality practices of the learners are mainly
concentrated in direct intertextuality, including direct quotations,
indirect quotations, and only relating to literature or authors (see
Table 4). Direct quotation is the most direct and prominent feature
of academic writing (Pecorari, 2006; Xu, 2012; Björk and Iyer,
2023). Citation is not only a discussion of previous research results,
but also a process of establishing connections between authors
and other members of the academic community. Quotation is
“an obvious sign of dialogism and intertextuality” (Swales, 2014,
p. 119). This is consistent with Ma and Qin (2014a), where direct
quotation strategies were used more frequently, indicating that the
learners have mastered basic academic norms (p. 94).
Previous studies have found that novice academic writers face
issues primarily manifested in inappropriate use of intertextuality
practices (Weigle and Parker, 2012; Ma, 2023). For example,
they tend to rely on quotation, relating to the literature or
authors or paraphrasing with minimal changes (Keck, 2006;
Weigle and Parker, 2012). As a result, writers extensively replicate
language from the resources without seamlessly integrating their
own viewpoints and positions with the literature. Moreover,
FIGURE 2
Intertextuality practice [adapted from Bazerman (2004) and Ma and
Qin (2015)].
due to misunderstandings or misuse of the resources, they
struggle to eﬀectively construct their identities as academic writers
(Cumming et al., 2005; Abasi et al., 2006). In consistency with
the previous studies, through intertextuality practice analysis, this
study found that the two participants overall mainly engaged in
direct quotation, indirect quotation, summary, paraphrase, and
translation. In the ﬁrst draft of academic writing, direct and
indirect quotations were predominantly used, while the utilization
of paraphrase and summaries was minimal. However, in the
ﬁnal draft of their academic writing, there was an increased
proportion of indirect quotations, paraphrase, and summaries.
This ﬁnding indicates that students in authentic academic writing
tasks have consciously engaged in extensive reading of relevant
foreign literature and have referred to the works of domestic
scholars, incorporating them into their own papers through various
intertextuality strategies (Ma and Qin, 2014b; Luzón, 2023). It is
noteworthy that, despite the prevalence of patch-writing, novice
writers still attempt to strengthen their voices and construct their

authorial identities through intertextuality (Ivaniˇc, 1998; Abasi
et al., 2006). Learners also encounter challenges in constructing
their identities as academic writers. For instance, when citing
literature, they struggle to enhance the interaction between text
and interlocutors by utilizing various rhetorical functions (Man-
sourizadeh and Ahmad, 2011). They also face diﬃculties in
expressing their own claims and asserting their voices based on
previous scholars’ perspectives (Abasi et al., 2006; Ma and Qin,
2014b, 2015).
4.2 Findings and discussion for RQ2: the
academic identity constructed through
intertextuality in academic writing
4.2.1 Extra-identity: “Autobiographical self” based
on what one has read, heard, and seen
As novice writers entering academic writing courses, both Xiao
xi and Xiao dong have mentioned the inﬂuence of their past
experiences on their writing. For instance, they would imitate
language by referring to sample texts they have read before, Xiao
xi believed that it is a way to gradually approach the writer’ s
style. This ﬁnding was consistent with Starﬁeld (2002), it was found
that successful writers are able to use their rich textual capital to
construct a convincing textual identity, while unsuccessful writers
who lack textual capital often resort to rigid imitation. Quellette
(2008) pointed out that a writer’s experiences play an important role
in constructing their “autobiographical self.”
Extract 1
“For example, when preparing for the writing competition
of the Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press, I
would refer to some sample essays, which provide me with a
background and an example of how to learn writing. Then I
would imitate their writing style and language use to complete
my own writing. For instance, recently I have been studying
the writing of expository essays, because I had little exposure
to them in English writing before. There are some expressions
that I am not very clear about, and I am not very good at using
them, such as when analyzing graphs and tables, he would write

a report and say something like what percentage accounts for
how many times. Previously, I would only use the expression
‘taking up some percentage.’ However, after reading this article,
I deliberately recorded some of these expressions and tried to
enrich my way of expression” (Xiaoxi-FT-202210).
At this stage, novice writers bring their past knowledge,
experiences, values, and beliefs into the writing process, reshaping
their current writing through their previous experiences. Xiao
xi automatically incorporated her previous experiences, namely
the way she learned to write, into her later writing. as the
beginners of second language writers, it is common in the initial
stages to acquire the academic language and imitate the discourse
structure of literature (Plakans and Gebril, 2012). By imitating the
academic language in literature, they hope to make their language
more standardized and academic. At the same time, through
language and structure imitation, they aim to bring themselves
closer to the writing of a “scholar.” However, due to factors such
as language proﬁciency, lack of academic writing training, and
insuﬃcient literature reading, learners are unsure how to express
their viewpoints and construct their authorial identity. Therefore,
they resort to direct intertextuality as a means to construct their
identity beyond the text.
Extract 2
I remember that a part of it probably came from observations
in my daily life. I noticed in class that many students
struggled with coherence and ﬂuency in their oral expressions.
Their expressions lacked coherence and semantic cohesion,
appearing fragmented at the sentence level and lacking overall
discourse coherence. Reﬂecting on my own experiences, I
realized that I also faced similar issues. This motivated me to
study this aspect in detail. Coincidentally, during the semester,
we learned about concepts such as copy and coherence, which
provided a theoretical framework for my research (Xiaodong-
FT-202210).
Findings were also consistent with Watanabe (2001), Gebril
and Plakans (2009) and Björk and Iyer (2023) in demonstrating
that students with higher levels of academic writing proﬁciency
are skilled at utilizing various literature resources, frequently
incorporating theories, deﬁnitions, research methods, and ﬁndings
from the previous studies. In contrast, students with lower
levels of academic writing proﬁciency lack knowledge on how to
use literature to articulate their viewpoints, resulting in limited
utilization of literature resources (Shi, 2004).
4.2.2 Textual identity: with conﬂicts between
reading and thinking, intertextuality is hard to
occur
Existing research has shown that learners face many diﬃculties
in developing their ability to use and read literature (Ma and
Qin, 2015). For example, when reading literature, Xiao dong with
lower language proﬁciency might have diﬃculty in extracting
and summarizing resources and a lower degree of intertextuality
awareness. Language proﬁciency can aﬀect the reading strategies
used by second language learners, and their responses and
interpretations of literature resources may diﬀer (McCulloch,
2013), as well as their sensitivity to intertextuality relationships
between literature. Both Xiao xi and Xiao dong emphasized that it
is hard for them to understand the literature at the beginning. From
Xiao xi’s description, it can be seen that she hopes to transform
from language imitation to content thinking, but due to her reading
proﬁciency, she cannot balance the two processes of reading and
thinking. In Plakans and Gebril (2012)’s study, they also found

that students ﬁrst focus on understanding the content during the
reading process and use relevant reading strategies to enhance their
understanding of literature. However, in this process, they do not
form their own dialog with the previous text, and intertextuality is
diﬃcult to occur.
Extract 3
“Then, based on my research purpose, I transform them and
constantly reorganize and reconstruct these texts to create my
own text. When I read papers, I may be divided into two parts.
The ﬁrst part is to understand the meaning of this paragraph,
and the second part is to pay attention to the language. When I
focus on the thinking, I may pay less attention to the language
form. Learning language form is based on my understanding
of the thinking. However, I feel that I may not be able to
transfer this kind of thinking enough when I write because
I haven’t read enough. This may be related to the language
proﬁciency of the learner. For example, high-level learners
may subconsciously study things beyond the level of text
comprehension on the basis of understanding the article, but
for low-level learners, understanding is already diﬃcult, and it
may be diﬃcult for them to absorb the text. That is to say, their
original language ability and language level cannot keep up
with their reading level, and they cannot produce such output”
(Xiaoxi-FT-202210).
Extract 4
I often ﬁnd it challenging to understand diﬃcult literature,
especially when reading academic papers. Therefore, my
primary concern is to address the issue of comprehension. It
takes me a signiﬁcant amount of time to fully grasp the content.
Once I have a clear understanding of the literature, I can then
focus on identifying the relevant information that I can cite
(Xiaodong-FT-202210).
This ﬁnding was also consistent with Xu (2011), which was
found that the lack of language expression ability can aﬀect Chinese
learners’ expression of their stance in academic writing. Therefore,
writers may struggle to express their own “voice” in the text. Most of
the content is reviewing and introducing literature in the relevant
ﬁeld (such as direct and indirect quotations), and the presented
viewpoints and stances are unclear.
4.2.3 Textual and contextual identity: with deep
reading and critical thinking, intertextuality
occurs
Xu (2021) mentioned that one of the “key” issues in second
language writing is the ability to participate in academic dialog,
which is particularly important for novice researchers. The ability
to establish a dialog relationship with existing research results
is most directly and commonly achieved through intertextuality
(Badenhorst, 2019). Students with professional thinking should
start from the previous texts, supported by relevant professional
theories and knowledge systems, and provide educated analysis
and interpretation (Qu, 2019). Xiao xi mentioned that, without
paying attention to language, she can understand the content of
literature and focus more on disciplinary knowledge related to her
research. In this process, academic writing courses provide her
with the content of disciplinary knowledge, and she uses it as a
basis to produce academic language. Learners ﬁrst collect literature
on the research topic (content), read between texts (absorb), use
intertextuality strategies (internalize, transform), summarize the
content of the text on the basis of understanding, and try to engage
in dialog with the reading text, hoping to achieve intertextuality of
disciplinary knowledge.
Extract 5
“When I can understand the content without paying attention
to the language, I begin to focus on the disciplinary content.
For example, I was studying scholars who research on code-
switching between Chinese and English, and I focused on
what they were speciﬁcally researching. Then I combined
their research with my own understanding to elaborate it in
my article. As for language, I learned how to use academic
language in academic writing classes, where the teacher showed
us examples of literature and explained how to use academic
language in academic writing. However, when I learned how to
use academic language in writing, I only read what the teacher
provided” (Xiaoxi-FT-202210).
Extract 6
It is in the later stages of academic writing that I have read and
understood most of the literature. Initially, I struggled to grasp
the concept of phonetics, to be honest. It was only through
continuous reading that I ﬁnally understood it. When it came
time to actually write, I realized how to incorporate the content
from the literature into my own writing, what to quote, and
what to summarize (Xiaodong-FT-202210).
The construction of successful and unsuccessful authorial
identities is shaped by the unequal dynamics of the academic
writing process, while learners’ social identities and social
relationships develop in complex ways within the discourse and
intertextuality of failure and success (Starﬁeld, 2002). Writing is a
dynamic process in which authors create new texts and meanings
based on previous texts. In addition to language proﬁciency,
disciplinary knowledge and professional training also have an
impact on identity construction, especially in academic writing,
particularly in high-level academic or professional writing (Chang,
2018). As the two participants in this study gain more academic
writing training, reading and academic writing practices and social
interaction, they gradually develop into more proﬁcient academic
writers from direct intertextuality to indirect intertextuality,
eventually integrating into the academic community and becoming
its members.
5 Conclusion and implications
The study has employed a mixed-methods approach to explore
authorial identity of Chinese EFL learners from an intertextuality
perspective. Findings suggested that learners, in order to enhance
Frontiers in Psychology

## Page 11

their authorial identities in academic writing, attempted to
construct their authorial identities through intertextuality. Their
intertextuality practices evolved from direct quotation and
replication to indirect integration, as their abilities to engage
with texts, awareness of citation, and consciousness of identity
construction gradually improved. The ﬁndings of this study
contribute to a better understanding of the process of constructing
authorial identities in academic writing for EFL learners. Their
ability to eﬀectively select and use language resources, express
ideas, and construct the self in writing to achieve intended
communicative purposes is of great signiﬁcance for EFL learners
(Tang and Xu, 2015). For the pedagogy of academic writing,
teachers should encourage and support students to grow as critical
thinkers and writers, fostering their desire to express ideas and
perform themselves through writing.
To enrich our understanding of EFL learners’ authorial identity,
more individuals and contexts need to be included in future
research. Future research can explore how EFL learners write
under conditions that they normally write in, which might yield
diﬀerent results. It is also worthwhile to explore how learners with
diﬀerent language proﬁciency using intertextuality to construct
their authorial identity. Finally, it would be useful to examine
writers’ intertextuality practices in academic writing from the
local, historical, and interactive levels of context to gain in-
depth and holistic understanding of learners’ authorial identity.
Although more studies are needed, this paper has exempliﬁed
a framework to re-conceptualize EFL learners’ authorial identity
from an intertextuality perspective.
