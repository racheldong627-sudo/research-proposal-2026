Chinese and American students’
rhetorical moves and stance

Dissertation is the most important research genre for graduate students as they
step into the academic community. The abstract found at the beginning of the
dissertation is an essential part of the dissertation, serving to “sell” the study
and impress the readers. Learning to compose a well-organized abstract to
promote one’s research is therefore an important skill for novice writers when
they step into the academic community in their discipline. By comparing 112
dissertation abstracts in material science by Chinese and American doctoral
students, this study attempts to analyze not only the rhetorical moves of
dissertation abstracts but also the lexical-grammatical features of stance in
diﬀerent abstract moves. The ﬁndings show that most of the abstracts include
ﬁve moves, namely, Situating the research, Presenting the research, Describing
the methodology, Summarizing the ﬁndings, and Discussing the research.
However, fewer abstracts by Chinese students include all ﬁve moves. In
addition, the choices of stance expressions by the two groups vary across
the ﬁve abstract moves for diﬀerent communication purposes. The results of
this study have pedagogical implications for facilitating the development of
academic writing skills for L2 writers.

Introduction
Theses and dissertations are the most important research genres for master’s
and Ph.D. students as they step into the academic community. Swales (2004, p. 99)
commented that “the dissertation/thesis is the most sustained and complex piece of
academic writing (in any language) they will undertake,” especially for non-native English
speakers (Sükan and Mohammadzadeh, 2022). As an abstract is a highly condensed and
conventionally structured text, the knowledge of the rhetorical moves of abstracts and
linguistic sources to realize these moves is essential for novice writers, particularly for L2
writers (Pho, 2008).

Swales (1990) deﬁnes the abstract as both a summary and
a “puriﬁed” reﬂection of the entire article. In addition to the
informative function, abstracts also function to promote the
research to the readers. Therefore, it is important to understand
the reader-writer interaction and the linguistic realization of
the promotional function in abstracts. Much attention has been
paid to the rhetorical moves (Santos, 1996; Can et al., 2016;
Tankó, 2017; Amnuai, 2019) and linguistic characteristics of
abstracts in research articles (Ebrahimi and Chan, 2015; Friginal
and Mastafa, 2017; Ansarifar et al., 2018). Dissertation abstracts,
however, diﬀer signiﬁcantly from research article abstracts in the
subcategories of moves and use of metadiscourse features (El-
Dakhs, 2018), and little is known about how L2 graduate writers
employ linguistic features to engage readers in dissertation
abstracts. The present study, therefore, aims at exploring not
only the rhetorical moves of dissertation abstracts by L2 graduate
students but also the lexical-grammatical features of stance in
diﬀerent abstract moves.
Literature review
Move structure of abstracts
The signiﬁcance of the abstract in academic writing lies
in the variety of functions and roles it plays (Ebrahimi and
Chan, 2015; Friginal and Mastafa, 2017; Nasseri and Thompson,
2021; Sükan and Mohammadzadeh, 2022). Firstly, it saves the
reader’s time by providing a condensed version of the whole
research article (RA). Secondly, it helps the readers to decide
on whether to continue to read the article. Thirdly, it has a
persuasive function in convincing journal editors to accept a
research article. Lastly, it also aids in indexing, which assists the
research article to be easily located in the database. Dissertation
abstracts can hold a higher stake than RA abstracts as the direct
reader of dissertations is the reviewer who evaluates the quality
of research and writing.
Following Swales’s (1990) move analysis, a ﬁve-move pattern
of abstracts was ﬁrst proposed by Santos (1996) which includes
Situating the research (M1), Presenting the research (M2),
Describing the methodology (M3), Summarizing the results
(M4), and Discussing the research (M5). Hyland (2000), based
on an analysis of 800 RA abstracts from eight disciplines,
proposed a similar ﬁve-move model: introduction, purpose,
method, product, and conclusion (IPMPC). In the same line of
research, Lorés (2004) found that 61% of 36 abstracts in the ﬁeld
of applied linguistics follow the IMRD structure (introduction-
method-result-discussion), while 31% of them employ the CARS
model (creating a research space), and 8% show a mixture of the
two structures.
It has been attested that Ph.D. thesis abstracts and RA
abstracts are two distinct genres, with the former representing
an educational genre, and the latter, a professional one (Kawase,
2015; El-Dakhs, 2018). El-Dakhs (2018) compared Ph.D. thesis
abstracts and RA abstracts in applied linguistics and found
that thesis abstracts included lengthier introductions while RA
abstracts provided a lengthier description of the methodology,
ﬁndings, and implications. Afzaal et al. (2019) noted that EFL
learners in Pakistan mostly followed Swales’ CARS model in the
abstract of master’s dissertations, but they used past participle in
the move of occupying the niche, suggesting a lack of conﬁdence
when presenting their own study. A review of these studies
suggests that it is insuﬃcient for novice writers to understand
the generic move structure of abstracts. It is equally important
for them to know how to realize rhetorical functions through
linguistic devices.
Stance in academic writing
Stance, a common feature concerned with writers’ or
speakers’ personal attitudes, feelings, or judgments about the
information communicated, has received increasing attention in
recent years (Hyland, 2005b; Biber, 2006; Du Bois, 2007; Aull,
2019; Kaltenböck et al., 2020; Zhang and Zhang, 2021). Stance
markers refer to the way that stance is expressed or realized,
including a range of grammatical devices like modal auxiliaries,
adverbial hedges, and complement clauses (Poole et al., 2019).
They function to express diﬀerent feelings such as the attitudes
that a speaker or writer has about the information (Biber, 2006).
Stance and stance markers play signiﬁcant roles in academic
writing but pose a challenge to academic writers. The author not
only needs to guarantee the credibility of the research and make
objective comments while reporting results or ﬁndings but also
has to establish an authorial presence to interact with readers as
well as acquire visibility in this ﬁeld (Can and Cangir, 2019).
The past decade has witnessed a growing interest in stance
and stance markers in academic writing. Following this line
of research are investigations of a variety of linguistic devices,
such as boosters and hedges (Hyland, 2012), personal pronouns
(Yang, 2016; Can and Cangir, 2019), reporting verbs (Hyland,
1999, 2002; Peng, 2019), and engagement sources (Lancaster,
2014). The results have conﬁrmed that academic writing, despite
its expected objectivity, involves the expression of an authorial
stance, including evaluation of previous studies, commitment to
one’s own claim, as well as attitudes toward one’s own research.
The identiﬁcation of stance features is highly context-
dependent, which can lead to fuzziness in the classiﬁcation. Biber
(2006), therefore, examines stance from a lexical-grammatical
approach which focuses on three categories of evaluative
language: modal and semi-modal verbs, stance adverbs, and
complement clauses controlled by stance verbs, adjectives, or
nouns. This classiﬁcation is more comprehensive and speciﬁc
in identifying stance features and has been adopted in several
studies on stance in academic writing (Chan, 2015; Çakir, 2016).

Stance in academic writing has been mainly examined from
two perspectives: cross-disciplinary (Hyland, 2005b; Chan, 2015;
Yang, 2016; Li, 2020) and cross-linguistic (Hu and Cao, 2011;
Mur-Dueñas, 2011; Kim and Lim, 2013; Jiang, 2015; Loi et al.,
2016; Bax et al., 2019). A comparison of research articles in
diﬀerent disciplines has shown that soft disciplines generally
employ more stance markers than hard disciplines (Hyland,
2005b; Chan, 2015). Interestingly, a diachronic study of stance
has found that the frequencies of stance markers are increasing
in the sciences and falling in the soft disciplines, demonstrating
a converging tendency (Hyland and Jiang, 2016).
As stance markers are used by writers to “engage with
the socially determined positions of others” (Hyland, 2005a,
p. 52), the deployment of these linguistic sources is expected to
vary across diﬀerent linguistic and cultural communities. For
instance, Chinese journal articles are found to include fewer
metadiscourse features, especially interactional metadiscourse
features (hedges, boosters) than English research articles (Mu
et al., 2015). The lower density of metadiscourse features in
Chinese journal articles is also consistent in diﬀerent parts
of the articles, including abstracts (Hu and Cao, 2011) and
introductions (Kim and Lim, 2013). These ﬁndings suggest the
avoidance of authorial presence in a reader-responsible context.
In such a context, Chinese ESL (English as a second
language) learners may transfer these norms from Chinese
academic writing to English academic writing. As Hyland (2004,
p. 141) argues, “the ways that writers present themselves,
negotiate an argument, and engage with their readers are closely
linked to the norms and expectations of particular cultural and
professional communities.” Many existing studies have revealed
diﬃculties in expressing the stance encountered by Chinese ESL
students (Li and Warton, 2012; Lee and Deakin, 2016; Afzaal
et al., 2021). Unlike their L1 peers, Chinese ESL students are
found to maintain a more detached and impersonal writing
style, and they are less strategic in making assertions (Lee
and Deakin, 2016; Yoon, 2020). Most of these ﬁndings are
based on argumentative writing by L2 students. As abstracts are
persuasive in nature, it can be assumed that L2 novice writers
may face similar challenges when drafting abstracts.
As mentioned in the last section, Ph.D. thesis abstracts diﬀer
from RA abstracts in the rhetorical structure. The linguistic
realization of the rhetorical moves and the use of stance markers
have also been found to be diﬀerent. For example, more hedges
and attitude verbs are found in Ph.D. thesis abstracts while the
abstracts of journal articles include more impersonal markers
and self-mentions (El-Dakhs, 2018). This diﬀerence suggests
that compared to RA authors, who are in a higher power status
in the scientiﬁc community, thesis writers as new members are
more cautious in taking responsibility for their claims.
Although much attention has been paid to stance markers
in academic writing and moves in abstracts, little is known
about how novice L2 writers employ stance markers in the
rhetorical moves in abstracts. In addition, most of the studies

on abstracts have involved cross-linguistic or cross-disciplinary
comparisons, and they have addressed disciplines in soft sciences
such as applied linguistics (Hu and Cao, 2011; Can et al., 2016;
Ansarifar et al., 2018; El-Dakhs, 2018; Nasseri and Thompson,
2021), literature, translation studies (Li, 2020), economics
(Ebrahimi and Chan, 2015), and accounting (Amnuai, 2019).
In contrast, abstracts in the hard sciences have received little
attention. In universities in China, except for language-related
studies, dissertations in other disciplines are written in Chinese.
Nevertheless, abstracts in both English and Chinese are required.
The dissertation abstract, therefore, is an ideal genre to examine
EFL students’ use of stance markers in academic writing. The
purpose of the present study is to examine the use of stance
markers in the moves structures of English abstracts written
by Chinese and American doctoral students. Speciﬁcally, the
present paper aims to answer the following two questions:
(1) Are there any similarities and diﬀerences between the
features of move structure in Chinese and American doctoral
students’ dissertation abstracts?
(2) What are the lexical-grammatical features of stance
in the ﬁve moves of Chinese and American students’
dissertation abstracts?
Methodology
Data collection
The corpus-based study aims to investigate the lexical-
grammatical features of stance in the move structures of English
dissertation abstracts written by Chinese and American Ph.D.
students. The data for this study include 112 English dissertation
abstracts written by Chinese and American doctoral students
majoring in materials science and engineering between 2010 and
2016. Two corpora were constructed as the corpus of Chinese
students’ abstracts (CCSA) and the corpus of American students’
abstracts (CASA). CCSA included 56 dissertation abstracts
extracted from the China Dissertation Database of Full Text. The
dissertations were selected from universities in seven areas of
China (i.e., North China, Central China, and Northwest China).
The 56 dissertation abstracts of CASA were selected from the
ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Database of Full text. The
dissertations were selected from universities in four areas of
America (i.e., North, South, West, and Midwest). Table 1 shows
the overall information of the two corpora.

Data analysis
All dissertation abstracts were analyzed in two ways. Firstly,
Santos (1996) ﬁve-move structure model was employed to
analyze the moves in the dissertation abstracts. The framework
for the move structure is presented in Table 2 with one Chinese
student’s dissertation abstract used as an example. Ten abstracts
were randomly selected and coded by the ﬁrst and third authors
separately. The coding was compared, and the agreement
rate reached 98%. The application of the coding scheme was
discussed. The third author then coded the rest of the data twice
in 2 weeks intervals. All uncertain or inconsistent cases were
discussed and settled among the three authors.
Secondly, stance markers in the dissertation abstracts were
identiﬁed based on Biber (2006) classiﬁcation of linguistic and
grammatical features of stance, including modal and semi-
modal verbs, stance adverbs, and stance-complement clauses
controlled by verbs, adjectives, or nouns. AntConc software
was used to identify the stance markers, and all identiﬁed
instances were manually checked and classiﬁed into diﬀerent
sub-categories according to the semantic meaning revealed
by the controlling stance word. Frequencies of the stance
features were then normalized to a relative frequency per
10,000 words to account for the diﬀerent sizes of the two
corpora. The distribution of stance features in each abstract
move was compared.
Findings
Move structure of abstracts in CCSA and
CASA
To answer the ﬁrst research question, moves in each
dissertation abstract in CCSA and CASA were identiﬁed based
on Santos (1996) ﬁve-move structure model. We ﬁrst counted
the number of moves in the abstracts to see if the abstracts
included all ﬁve moves. The general move structure of abstracts
in the two corpora is presented in Table 3.
As seen in Table 3, most abstracts in both corpora include
four or ﬁve moves (89.28% for CCSA and 94.64% for CASA).
Very few abstracts have an incomplete structure with three
moves. Fewer abstracts in CCSA include four or ﬁve moves than
in CASA, though the average length of abstracts in CCSA is near
twice the length of abstracts in CASA (see Table 1).
To examine the distribution of the ﬁve moves in the two
corpora, the length and occurrence of each move were counted
(see Table 4). As seen in Table 4, the largest portion of the
abstracts in both corpora is devoted to the Summarizing the
ﬁndings move, and the second and third largest portions are
Describing the method and Situating the research respectively.
Compared to American students, Chinese students put more
emphasis on the research result with more than half of the
abstract summarizing the ﬁndings, leaving very little room
for discussing the research. In contrast, the length of each
move in American students’ abstracts is more balanced. On the
other hand, the occurrence of each move is similar in both
corpora. Most abstracts in both corpora include three obligatory
moves: Presenting the research, Describing the methodology,
and Summarizing the ﬁndings.
Stance features of abstracts in CCSA and
CASA
To answer the second research question, stance markers
in both corpora were identiﬁed and classiﬁed, and then the
normalized frequencies were calculated and compared. Biber
(2006) divides stance markers into three categories: modals and
semi-modals, stance adverbs, and stance-complement clause
constructions. Table 5 presents the frequencies of the three
major categories of stance markers in CCSA and CASA.
Table 5 shows no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the total number
of stance markers between the two corpora (p > 0.05). Both
groups use stance-complement clauses the most, and the
American students employ slightly more of them than Chinese
students (p = 0.05). The second preferred category for both
groups is modal and semi-modal verbs and Chinese students
employ signiﬁcantly more of them than American students (p <
0.05). The least preferred category by the two groups is stance
adverbs. The frequency of stance adverbs used by American
students is higher than that of Chinese students.
As the most common category in both corpora, stance-
complement clauses are further divided into verb-complement
clauses, adjective-complement clauses, and noun-complement
clauses. The results are presented in Table 6. A closer look
at the sub-categories of the stance construction reveals some
noticeable discrepancies between the two corpora. As shown in
Table 6, both groups rely heavily on stance verb-complement
clauses to show stance in the abstracts. Chinese students
show a remarkable preference for the stance verb + that-
clauses while American students use more stance verb +
to-clauses than Chinese students. Stance-complement clauses
controlled by adjectives and nouns were rarely found in the two
corpora, although American students employed signiﬁcantly
more stance noun + to-clauses than Chinese students (p
< 0.05).
As for the choice of stance verb-complement construction
in CCSA and CASA, it was noted that American students
employed a similar amount of that- and to-clauses, whereas
Chinese students preferred that-clauses to to-clauses. Signiﬁcant
diﬀerences were found between the two student groups
in their use of stance verb + that-complement clauses
and stance verb + to-complement clauses (p < 0.05).
Speciﬁcally, in contrast to their American counterparts,

Chinese students tend to overuse that-clauses controlled by
communication verbs and epistemic certainty verbs (p <
0.05), but underuse to-clauses controlled by mental verbs and
communication verbs (p < 0.05). In-depth analysis reveals
that the stance verb + that-complement construction in
both corpora is particularly common with communication
verbs (e.g., show, indicate, reveal, and demonstrate) and
verbs expressing epistemic certainty (e.g., ﬁnd, determine,
and conclude).
Example 1: The results show that antimony, tin oxide,
ferric oxide can improve ﬁre-resistance time and reduce smoke
density (CCSA-02).
Example 2: Lastly, it was determined that the fabrication
process greatly inﬂuences the impurity types and concentrations
of the alloys, and therefore greatly dictate which thermal stability
mechanisms care active (CASA-21).
In examples 1 and 2, stance verb + that-complement clauses
are accompanied by inanimate subjects in both sentences.
This structure is used to report information in an impersonal
way, which conforms to the typical characteristics of academic
writing. Both groups prefer that-clauses controlled by certainty
verbs and communication verbs, which implies their conﬁdence
in the reported information.
Diﬀerent from the use of stance verb + that-clauses in
both corpora, the stance verb + to-complement construction
is frequently employed with mental and communication verbs,
especially among CASA.
Example 3: The Sb composition is found to vary non-linearly
with substrate temperature and V/III ratios (CCSA-28).
Example 4: Instead, color center formation was shown to
be controlled by oxidation and reduction of variable valence
impurity ions, primarily Fe 2+/3+ (CASA-26).
As seen in examples 3 and 4, similar to that-clauses, stance
verb + to-complement clauses usually appear with impersonal
subjects, which demonstrates the objectivity and impartiality
of the writers in declaring information. Nevertheless, the use
of the mental verb ﬁnd and communication verb show by the
writers indicate a higher degree of certainty to the reported
information, thus increasing the force of their claim. The
two words ﬁnd and show take up more than half of the

Stance features in diﬀerent moves of
abstracts in CCSA and CASA
This section reports various types of stance markers
across ﬁve moves of abstracts by both student groups. As
shown in Table 7, the overall use of stance markers across
the ﬁve moves in CCSA and CASA corpora have similar
distribution characteristics. There are more stance markers in
STR, STF, and DTR moves than in PTR and DTM moves
in both corpora. It is noteworthy that American students
use more stance markers in STR, PTR, DTM, and STF
moves of abstracts than Chinese students, except for the DTR
move. The distribution of stance markers is closely related to
the diﬀerent functions of each move. Situating the research
(STR) move serves to set the scene or present background
information for the study, which states the signiﬁcance of
the present study. Summarizing the ﬁndings (STF) move,
which reports the ﬁndings and discusses the research part,
shows a detailed interpretation of the results. However,
presenting the research (PTR) move gives the hypothesis,
and describing the methodology (DTM) move describes the
methods of the study, in both of which an objective tone
is expected.
The following sections provide a detailed examination of the
distribution of diﬀerent types of stance markers in every move
of abstracts in CCSA and CASA.
Stance features in the STR move
The situating the research (STR) move in the abstracts
serves to set the scene for the research and establish the
signiﬁcance of the current study (Hyland, 2000). As shown
in Table 7, the distributions of stance markers in this move
in the CCSA and CASA abstracts are similar. No signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the frequencies of the ﬁve categories were
identiﬁed between the two corpora (p > 0.05). In presenting
this move, both groups of students favor modal verbs and
stance verb-complement clauses the most, and stance noun-
complement clauses the least. Further analysis shows that both
groups prefer possibility modals in modal verbs the most and the
other sub-classes of stance markers are remarkably less common
than possibility modals.
Both Chinese and American students use various stance
devices in this move to emphasize the signiﬁcance of their
research topic, which is useful for setting the scene for the
present research. Particularly remarkable is the frequent use of
modal verbs in the STR move. The possibility modal can is
used with inanimate subjects to show ability or logical possibility
meaning, as can be seen in examples 5 and 6.

Example 5: However, the performance of lithium ion
batteries can no longer satisfy the ever increasing demands
for high energy density even though they almost reach the
theoretical limit both in mass and volume. Therefore, the
improvement of the research for lithium ion batteries is
urgent (CCSA-31).
Example 6: For instance, the ability to create controllable
nanostructures in a scalable manner can enable the wide use of
nanotechnology (CASA-07).
As shown in examples 5 and 6, the possibility modal
can is utilized with inanimate subjects by both Chinese and
American students. Example 5 stated that lithium-ion batteries
fail to meet the demands, thus providing a rationale for the
current study. Example 6 suggested the necessity to develop
a new function of nanotechnology. The choice of can shows
the possibility of conducting research related to this topic from
diﬀerent perspectives.
In contrast, the necessity modals (must and should) are less
frequently employed than the possibility modals in the STR
move in CCSA and CASA. Both must and should express the
necessity, which can boost the claim expressed in the sentence.
The word must is commonly used to express any unavoidable
requirement or obligation. When they are employed in this
move, the personal obligation voiced by them indicates the
writer’s emphasis on the necessity of the present study. This can
explain why necessity modals appear more frequently in this
move than in the other four moves of abstracts. For instance:
Example 7: The most eﬃcient mode of transportation of
petroleum-based fuel is via pipelines, and due to the 300%
increase in ethanol use in the U.S. in the past decade, a similar
method of conveyance must be adopted for ethanol (CASA-29).
Example 8: Therefore, the segregation behavior of B should
be conﬁrmed and the recovery rate of Si should be improved
during the alloy solidiﬁcation reﬁning process (CCSA-07).
As seen in examples 7 and 8, must and should demonstrate
the writers’ advocacy of the action introduced in the clause,
as well as the writers’ conﬁdence in claiming authority in the
research area.
Stance features in the PTR move
As shown in Table 7, presenting the research (PTR) move
includes the least stance markers in the two corpora partly
because of its function to present the objective or hypothesis
of the research in academic papers. The occurrence of diﬀerent
kinds of stance markers employed by American students is

signiﬁcantly higher than by Chinese students, with no exception
(X² = 6.116, p < 0.05).
It is noteworthy that both corpora contain more to-clause
controlled by verbs of eﬀort (try, seek) in the PTR move
compared to the other moves. We can see in examples 9 and 10,
the writers’ employment of the stance resources demonstrates
their purposes of stating the attempt and endeavor of their
research eﬀort, which is a useful way to accomplish the goal of
presenting the research objective of the PTR move. For instance:
Example 9: In this thesis, we try to introduce a new weak
(soft) phase on the basis of traditional nanoglass, to replace the
role of grain boundaries, construct a new kind of nanoglass
composite (CCSA-38).
Example 10: This investigation seeks to determine if current
superalloy casting methods can result in the formation of oxide
biﬁlms... (CASA-34)
In addition, some instances of epistemic likelihood verbs +
that clauses and stance adjectives + to clauses exist in the PTR
move of CASA. For instance:
Example 11: It was hypothesized that atmospheric pressure
plasma treatment could functionalize and/or remove peel ply
remnants on the CFRP surfaces to improve adhesion (CASA-
54).
Example 12: Although the exact form of y(V) is unclear, it is
reasonable to assume an exponentially-decaying form of y(V),
where at low temperatures γ is... (CASA-31)
In example 11, the writer’s uncertainty about the claim is
revealed by the use of an extraposed that-clause controlled by
the epistemic likelihood verb (hypothesize) and the combination
of the modal verb with tentative meaning (could) in that-
clause, which serves to present the hypothesis and indicate
the writer’s discretion in making the assumption. In example
12, the use of extraposed to-clause controlled by an adjective
(reasonable) conveys a positive evaluation of this assumption.
In both examples, the American students make the assumptions
more convincing with the use of stance expressions. Although
stance devices in the PTR move are the fewest in both corpora,
the American students use more of these devices than the
Chinese students to strengthen their personal involvement in the
presentation of the research objective.
Stance features in the DTM move
Few stance expressions are found in describing the
methodology move in both corpora. This is because the
major function of this move is to introduce the methods and
procedures for conducting the study. In this move, CCSA
contains signiﬁcantly fewer stance markers than in CASA (X²
= 16.450, p = 0.000), and Chinese students employ signiﬁcantly
fewer modal verbs, stance adverbs as well as stance adjective +
to-clauses than the American students (p < 0.05). The possibility
modals are the most common stance markers used by both
student groups. For instance:
Example 13: The objective of these experiments was
to correlate observations of slip transfer with a geometric
parameter m’, which can be used to identify and predict
crystallographic arrangements that are better suited for slip
transfer (CASA-03).
Example 14: So we introduce the method that can remove or
weaken undesired carrier localization (CCSA-28).
In examples 13 and 14, the use of the possibility modal can
in the description of methodology shows the justiﬁcation of
the methods employed. The considerably higher use of modals,
especially possibility modals, in the DTM move of CASA than
that of CCSA (X² = 4.500, p < 0.05) suggests that the American
students’ greater eﬀorts in justifying the choice of research
tools and methods in this move. Regarding stance adverbs in
DTM move, style adverbs and epistemic likelihood adverbs are
preferred by American students. For instance:
Example 15: Speciﬁcally, tensile stress generation was
evaluated using an in situ wafer curvature measurement
technique, and correlated with the inclination of edge-type
threading dislocations observed with transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (CASA-24).
Example 16: In particular, the use of nanosphere lithography
to pattern thin ﬁlms of aluminum prior to anodization is
described, which allows for nearly arbitrary control of the pore
size, interpore spacing and aspect ratio (CASA-07).
The style adverb speciﬁcally in example 15 indicates the
writer’s attempt to describe the research methods to the readers
in detail. The likelihood adverb nearly in example 16 shows
the writer’s caution when introducing the eﬀectiveness of the
research procedure. Both examples show American students’
objectiveness in presenting the methodology, which is enhanced
by stance adverbs.
Stance features in the STF move
Summarizing the ﬁndings (STF) move takes up the largest
portion of the abstracts in both corpora and it involves the
frequent occurrence of stance expressions. Results indicate
that the American students employ signiﬁcantly more stance
verb-complement clauses (X² = 13.837, p = 0.000), whereas
the Chinese students use signiﬁcantly more modals than the
American students (X² = 31.922, p = 0.000). Stance verb-
complement clauses have the highest frequency in STF move in
both corpora. In contrast, stance noun-complement clauses have
the lowest frequency in both corpora. Unlike American students,
Chinese students show a preference for modal verbs over stance
adverbs in this move.
A close examination of the subcategories of stance
expressions in the STF move shows that the stance verb +
that-clauses is the most preferred device used by Chinese and
American students. To be speciﬁc, that-complement clauses
occur mostly after communication verbs (such as indicate and
show) and epistemic certainty verbs (such as ﬁnd and determine)
Frontiers in Psychology

in both groups. Examples 17 and 18 are two instances of stance
verb + that-clause controlled by communication verbs (indicate
and show) in the STF move.
Example 17: The simulations indicate that the particle size
dependent velocity of the sedimentation increases the rate at
which the system coarsens (CASA–10).
Example 18: The results show that the wear resistance of
WC/Co-Cr composite coating is better than H13 steel (CCSA-
23).
The communication verbs show and indicate are the
most preferred stance verbs used by both students in STF
move. Textual analysis reveals that stance verb + that-clauses
controlled by communication verbs occur most frequently
with inanimate subjects, such as “simulations” and “results” in
examples 17 and 18. This shows the writers’ objectivity and
certainty toward their results when reporting their ﬁndings.
Both student groups report the ﬁndings with words with high
certainty to establish their personal expertise, thus making the
ﬁndings more convincing.
In addition to the stance verb + that-clause, the stance
verb + to clause, especially the to-clause controlled by mental
and communication verbs, is also frequently used by American
students in the STF move. However, this stance device is rarely
found in Chinese students’ abstracts. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were
found between their overall use of stance verb + to-clauses (X²
= 91.104, p = 0.000), as well as their use of to-clauses controlled
by mental and communication verbs (p = 0.000 for both). To-
clauses in CASA were frequently controlled by mental verbs
(such as ﬁnd, determine, and observe) and communication verbs
(such as show and conﬁrm). Textual analysis shows that they
often occur with subjects concerning the research-related object
or process to denote objectiveness in the presentation of the
ﬁndings (such as ﬁnd and show), and the verbs selected are often
with high certainty. For instance:
Example 19: The dissolution behavior of disordered
Fe50Pd50 was found to strongly relate to the crystallographic
orientation of speciﬁc grains (CASA-41).
Example 20: Finally, non-planar LEDs were shown to
exhibit broader light-emission spectra than conventional planar
LEDs (CASA-09).
In examples 19 and 20, the stance verb + to-clause in the
STF move shares a similar role with that-clause, but the Chinese
students seem to ignore this function of to-clauses in the STF
move and tend to overuse that-clauses.
When presenting the ﬁndings of the current research,

and

students

and

The
Chinese students prefer verb + that-clauses to verb +
to-clauses in STF move. In contrast, American students
employ more stance verb-complement clauses with high
certainty to make the research ﬁndings more powerful
and forceful.
Stance features in the DTR move
Consistent with the argumentative nature, discussing the
research (DTR) move in both corpora includes the most stance
expressions. Results demonstrate that the two corpora are
similar in the distribution of stance expressions, with modal
verbs being the most frequently used and followed by stance
verb-complement clauses and stance adverbs. Nevertheless,
signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between the two corpora
in the frequency of stance devices employed in this move.
Speciﬁcally, the DTR move of CCSA contains signiﬁcantly more
modal verbs and stance verb-complement clauses (p < 0.05).
Modal verbs are the most preferred grammatical stance
device in this move in both corpora, which are more frequent
than in the other four moves.
Example 21: It proves that the wet-mix shotcrete with high
air content can solve the inharmonious contradiction between
pumpability and shootability (CCSA-46).
Example 22: The ﬁndings of this research will hopefully
guide
future
eﬀorts
to
design
more
thermally
stable
nanocrystalline alloys (CASA-21).
The use of possibility or prediction modals in examples 21
and 22 indicates the writer’s conﬁdence in the ﬁndings. Can in
Example 21 implies that the present research is meaningful and
will in example 22 suggests the future positive inﬂuence of the
current research results. Moreover, it is also noteworthy that the
use of the verb of eﬀort/ facilitation + to-clause in the DTR
move of both corpora contains the most frequent occurrence.
In examples 23 and 24, the students choose to use verbs of
facilitation (help and allow) to demonstrate their attitude that
the results of the present research are valuable, which indicates
the importance of the study. For example:
Example 23: These results help to control the conditions for
generating the continuous and uniform carburized layer on the
surface and around the pore wall of porous TiAl alloy (CCSA-
52).
Example 24: A potential consequence of this study would be
the development of a superior armor material that is suﬃciently
aﬀordable, allowing it to be incorporated into the general
soldier’s armor chassis (CASA-33).
Stance adverbs are also common in this move of both
corpora, especially likelihood adverbs and style adverbs.
For instance:
Example 25: The initial crystalline thickness increase was
mainly due to the crystallization of some tie chains in the
amorphous region, as well as small transformation of diﬀuse
transition layer into crystalline region (CASA-17).
Example 26: The remarkably enhanced performance of
lithium electrode could probably be attributed to the eﬀective

protection of a unique SEI layer; formed under the synergistic
eﬀect of LiFSI and DOL (CCSA-40).
The adverbs in the two examples are used in the
interpretation of the research results. The use of style adverbs
(mainly) in example 25 in this move suggests the writers’ attitude
that their explanation is rational and acceptable but there may
be other possible causes behind the results. And the likelihood
adverb probably in example 26 is to demonstrate the writers’
caution and prudence in the interpretation. Both groups utilize
stance adverbs to avoid being assertive in making claims, which
demonstrates their respect for opinions from their community
and makes their explanation of results more acceptable to
the readers.
Chinese and American students have similar preferences in
the choice of stance markers in the DTR move of the abstract. On
the one hand, they utilize possibility and prediction modals and
verbs of facilitation + to-clauses to show the positive impacts
of the research results. On the other hand, they prefer to use
that and to-clauses controlled by communication verbs and
mental verbs as well as style and likelihood adverbs to show
their respect for diﬀerent opinions, which makes the research
signiﬁcance more credible. Both groups employ diﬀerent stance
devices in the DTR move to realize the interpersonal function of
the abstract.
Discussion
Taken
together,
the
ﬁndings
reveal
a
similar
move
structure; but the divergence is apparent in the lexical-
grammatical features in the dissertation abstracts by Chinese
and American students.
In response to the ﬁrst research question, most abstracts
in both corpora include four or ﬁve moves, indicating a
comprehensive understanding of the rhetorical features of the
writers (Sükan and Mohammadzadeh, 2022). Within those ﬁve
moves, Presenting the research, Describing the methodology,
and Summarizing the ﬁndings are found in most abstracts,
supporting previous research ﬁndings (Santos, 1996; Pho, 2008;
Can et al., 2016; Sükan and Mohammadzadeh, 2022). This
is especially true for dissertation abstracts in the current
study, all of which report empirical studies in the discipline
of materials science and engineering in IMRD (introduction-
methods-results-discussion) format. In terms of the length of
each move, the emphasis on the Summarizing the ﬁndings move
by both groups conforms with the ﬁndings of El-Dakhs (2018),
which is a salient feature of scientiﬁc discourse. American
students put more balanced emphasis on Situating the research,
Describing the method, and Summarizing the ﬁndings moves
in abstracts of journal articles. In contrast, Chinese students
focus more on Summarizing the ﬁndings. This is diﬀerent from
Ren and Li (2011) ﬁnding which shows that Chinese students
over-emphasize the introduction move in MA thesis in applied
linguistics. The reason for this incongruence can be disciplinary
diﬀerences. Scientiﬁc discourse, as McKenny and Bennett (2011)
point out, is characterized by the presentation of facts while
social science and humanities rely more on argumentation. The
results of the move structure in the abstracts by the two groups
suggest a larger eﬀect of disciplinary norms than cultural factors.
In response to the second research question, we ﬁrst looked
at the overall lexical-grammatical features of stance in the
dissertation abstracts. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in
the total number of stance expressions in CCSA and CASA. Both
groups employed stance-complement clauses the most, followed
by modal and semi-modal verbs and stance adverbs. This
supports Biber (2006) observation of the lexical-grammatical
features of the written registers. However, Chinese students use
signiﬁcantly more modals and semi-modals while American
students use more stance adverbs. This is in line with Çakir
(2016) ﬁnding that native writers employ more stance adverbs
in abstracts than L2 writers.
Although no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between
the overall frequencies of stance-complement construction in
the CCSA and CASA, the use of stance verb-complement
construction diﬀered in the two corpora. Stance verb + to-
complement construction shares a similar function to that-
complement construction in abstracts. Both constructions
are likely to appear with inanimate subjects to indicate
objectiveness, and they are often controlled by verbs with a
higher degree of conviction and certainty, such as ﬁnd and
show. The inanimate subject structure can reveal the authors’
conﬁdence in the information, thus collaboratively enhancing
the persuasiveness of abstracts. However, compared to their
American counterparts, Chinese students tended to limit their
choice to that-complement construction but underused to-
complement clauses followed by ﬁnd and show. This is in
line with Charles (2006) ﬁnding that ﬁnd/show verbs are the
most frequently used reporting verbs in doctoral theses in
material science, displaying the author’s detailed knowledge of
the research.
In terms of the distribution of stance markers in diﬀerent
moves, the results show that three moves (Situating the research,
Summarizing the ﬁndings, and Discussing the results) in
abstracts in both corpora are heavily loaded with stance markers
while the other two moves include few stance features. This
supports Pho (2008) ﬁnding that rhetorical devices are scarcely
found in Presenting the research and Describing the Method
moves. Both groups preferred to use possibility modals such
as can and may in Situating the research move to emphasize
the importance of their research topics. The employment of
modal verbs such as may and can when summarizing the
previous ﬁndings to lead to their own study can reduce the
deﬁniteness of the claim concerning previous research and
take the responsibility oﬀthe present writer (Pho, 2008). In
Summarizing the ﬁndings move, however, possibility modals
are used to show the writer’s caution about the outcome of

the current study. Modals in Discussing the results move
have two functions: allowing alternative interpretations of the
results (with the use of possibility modals) and emphasizing the
signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings (with the prediction modals, such as
will). This ﬁnding is in line with Pho (2008) observation that
writers prefer to use modal verbs as hedging or boosting device
in the DTR move.
Next to modal verbs, stance verb-complement clauses are
the second most preferred stance device employed by both
groups, particularly in Summarizing the ﬁndings and Discussing
the research moves. This is most likely due to the multiple
functions of verbs in conveying the epistemic meaning that is
dominant in abstracts (Hyland, 2000). It is interesting to note
that Chinese students use more stance verb-complement clauses
in Discussing the research move while American students use
more of them in Summarizing the ﬁndings moves. In the
Summarizing the ﬁndings move, complement clauses followed
by ﬁnd/show verbs are used to present the writer’s own ﬁndings.
This is consistent with Pho (2008) ﬁnding that the principal
syntactic feature of the STF move is the employment of that-
complement structure controlled by the reporting verbs. In
contrast, the complement clauses in Discussing the research
move, particularly the verb of eﬀort/ facilitation + to-clause,
help to highlight the value of the research ﬁndings.
Stance adverbs are the least frequent stance markers used
by both groups, most of which are found in the Summarizing
the ﬁndings and Discussing the research moves. The frequent
use of stance adverbs (probably and mainly) in Discussing
the research move suggested Chinese and American students’
interpretation of the research results in a cautious way. This can
be attributed to the tentativeness of researchers when explaining
their research ﬁndings (Pho, 2008). Despite the shorter length
of Discussing the research move, abstracts by Chinese students
are more densely loaded with stance expressions, particularly
modal verbs, than abstracts by American students. This suggests
L2 writers lack conﬁdence when making claims based on the
research ﬁndings.
Overall, the stance expressions across the ﬁve moves
used by the two student groups shared similar distributional
features. The DTR, STF, and STR moves are more densely
loaded with stance expressions than the DTM and PTR
moves in both corpora. The diﬀerent functions of the
moves were realized with the use of these stance features,
pinpointing the necessity of conducting the study, establishing
the credibility of the research ﬁndings, or highlighting the
signiﬁcance of the research. This indicates students’ good
understanding of the rhetorical function of each move and
control of the degree of authorial voice expressed in each
move. As pointed out by Li (2020), abstracts function
to inform and persuade readers. While students in both
groups are aware of discipline-speciﬁc knowledge of abstracts,
the American students seemed to promote their research
more consciously with the use of a variety of stance
devices than the Chinese students in the PTR, DTM, and
STF moves.
Conclusion
The present study investigated the lexical-grammatical
features of stance in English dissertation abstracts written
by Chinese and American students majoring in materials
science and engineering. Both similarities and diﬀerences were
identiﬁed in the move structure in Chinese and American
doctoral students’ dissertation abstracts. Abstracts in both CCSA
and CASA corpora include four or ﬁve moves, but American
students’ move structure of abstracts is generally more balanced
than their Chinese counterparts, with each move present in
most abstracts. In contrast, Chinese students’ abstracts were
characterized by a longer average length with fewer moves. Both
groups underscored the signiﬁcance of DTM (describing the
method) and STF (stating the ﬁndings) moves in the abstracts.
However, compared to their American counterparts, Chinese
students concentrated more on STR (situating the research)
than PTR (presenting the research) and DTR (discussing the
research) in abstracts.
Some similarities and diﬀerences in the overall distribution
of lexical-grammatical features could be found in the ﬁve moves
of CCSA and CASA corpora. The distribution of the three
main categories of stance expressions was similar in Chinese
and American students’ abstracts, with stance-complement
clauses being the most preferred stance device and stance
adverbs being the least used one. Similar features were also
found in the distribution of sub-categories of these stance
expressions, with both preferring possibility modals, stance
verb-complement clauses, and style and likelihood adverbs.
However, in comparison with their American counterparts, the
Chinese students preferred modal verbs and stance verbs +
that-clauses to express stance, but they seldom employed stance
adverbs and stance verbs + to-clauses.
The ﬁndings of the present study have pedagogical
implications
for
academic
writing.
The
results
suggest
that Chinese students face some challenges in the textual
organization of English abstracts. Since Chinese students’
dissertations in material science are composed in Chinese,
the required abstract in English is very likely to be translated
from the Chinese abstract, maintaining the textual features of
the Chinese version. Therefore, rhetorical moves and stance
markers of research article abstracts should be incorporated
into the instruction of academic writing (Zhang and Zhang,
2021). Teachers can highlight the importance of these moves
in writing an English abstract with both informative and
persuasive functions. Discussion on the diﬀerences between
the writing convention in English and Chinese would beneﬁt
L2 students’ English abstract writing. Additionally, writing
instructors can provide students with feedback on their use

of stance markers in academic writing to make stance more
visible. Some meaningful ﬁndings have emerged from the
current study, yet there exist some inevitable limitations.
Firstly, the sizes of the corpora are relatively small, which
may restrict the generalizability of the ﬁndings. Secondly, the
study focuses only on a single discipline and may not provide
a comprehensive understanding of students’ stance features
in abstract moves. Therefore, future studies could construct a
larger corpus to cover abstracts from diﬀerent disciplines and
conduct cross-disciplinary research on the choice of stance
devices in diﬀerent abstract moves. Moreover, a comparative
study on the use of various stance devices in diﬀerent moves
of abstracts by students at diﬀerent proﬁciency levels is also
expected to provide meaningful ﬁndings.
