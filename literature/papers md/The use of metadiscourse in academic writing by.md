ABSTRACT 
Metadiscourse refers to linguistic items, which functions to establish a connection with imagined 
readers of a text (Hyland, 2004). The use of metadiscourse has received much attention in various 
contexts, yet, little works are focusing on disciplinary metadiscourse, that has been carried out. 
To address this gap, this study explored, described, and compared the use of disciplinary 
metadiscourse by eight Malaysian first-year ESL doctoral students across four areas of study in 
education. The study reported in this article focuses on development or changes in writing over 
time. This study is quantitative in nature with a corpus-based approach utilizing AntConc (3.4.4) 
to examine the frequency of three dimensions of academic discourse in their writing, namely 
textual, engagement, and evaluative The results of this analysis show that (i) the engagement 
dimension (3.1%) was the lowest of all three dimensions in written work, reinforcing the 
argument that first-year ESL doctoral students are less experienced at using textual metadiscourse 
resources, and (ii) frequency of all three dimensions of academic discourse in their writing differs 
across time between first written drafts to the final written drafts. These are first-year ESL 
doctoral students, who are writing in different fields of educational research. The implication is 
that teaching and learning of disciplinary metadiscourse should involve explicit explanation, 
demonstration, and practice of its use, and development in the academic writing process.

INTRODUCTION 
Academic writing is often seen as the underlying 
problem in higher education especially for first-year 
ESL doctoral students, regardless of the major, in the 
field of studies (Aitchison & Lee, 2006; Kamler & 
Thomson, 2014). As this may contribute to tensions 
and challenges doctoral students encounter due to 
uncertainty that, whether their practices aligned with 
those of the discipline (Bieber & Worley, 2006; 
Hyland, 2012; Park, 2013), a new note of urgency, 
which calls for research on strategic manipulation of 
interpersonal and rhetorical elements in academic 
writing (Ho & Li, 2018; Hyland, 2014; Hyland & 
Jiang, 2018). In response to this, some researchers 
and teachers of academic writing in academic 
contexts have focused on researching textual, 
engagement, and evaluative dimensions of academic 
discourse. As reviewed by Kuhi and Behnam (2011), 
many of these studies ‘can be clustered under the 
uniting 
umbrella 
of 
metadiscourse’ 
(p.98). 
Metadiscourse refers to linguistic items that function 
to establish a connection with imagined readers of a 
text (Hyland, 2004). 
Metadiscourse was first introduced by Harris 
(1959) in applied linguistics, which later evolved 
through the work of Vande Kopple’s (1985) as 
‘discourse about discourse’, Crismore’s (1989) as 
‘discoursing about the discourse’ and Williams’

(1981) as ‘writing about writing’. While several 
researchers (Crismore & Farnsworth, 1990; Hyland, 
2004, 2005; Swales, 1990) have acknowledged the 
vagueness of the concept as metadiscourse lacks 
theorization, 
clear 
definitions, 
and functions, 
Halliday (1994) suggested that language should 
fulfill three functions namely: ideational, textual and 
interpersonal. This suggestion builds on the 
connection of metadiscourse to the work of others 
scholars, such as, Jakobson’s (1980) metalinguistic 
function, Hyland’s (2004) self-reflective linguistic 
expression, Hyland, and Hyland and Tse’s (2004) 
interactive and interactional resources, and Hyland’s 
(2017) idea, where ‘language does not only refers to 
the world, concerned with exchanging information of 
various kinds but also itself: with material which 
helps readers to organize, interpret and evaluate what 
is 
being 
said’ 
(p.17). 
This 
idea 
embraces 
metadiscourse 
functions. 
In 
other 
words, 
metadiscourse has textual functions, that help writers 
to negotiate the meaning and ‘engage with readers as 
members of a particular community’ (Hyland, 2005, 
pp.37).  
As Hyland (2005) argues, writing involves 
meaning-making. Thus, academic writing done with 
limited awareness and knowledge of textual and 
rhetorical elements becomes problematic. This is 
seen as a sign of deficit, that disrupts the flow of 
argument, intention, and voice in writing, while also 
affecting a writer’s choice of words. These may 
accumulate to the issues of doctoral students’ 
withdrawal and complications in completing their 
doctorate studies (Jones, 2011; Kamler & Thomson, 
2014). In an ESL learning context, first-year doctoral 
students are newcomers in their selected field of 
studies and face more challenges in the L2 academic 
writing process because they are required to write in 
a second language, in which many of them may not 
be fully proficient (Matsuda et al., 2013). Yet, 
general academic writing classes and courses still 
emphasize the teaching of L2 written structure, than 
on developing writers’ awareness in using textual, 
engagement, and evaluative dimensions of academic 
discourse in an academic context (Cimasko & 
Reichelt, 2011; Juliaty, 2019). The concepts of 
textual, engagement and the evaluative dimension of 
academic discourse will be explained in the 
metadiscourse section below. The lack of awareness 
is an issue in the teaching and learning of academic 
writing and English for Specific Purposes (ESP) in 
university where the importance of disciplinary 
writing and rhetorical elements is fundamental for 
effective communication in academic writing 
(Bhatia, 2014; Coffin et al., 2005; Evans & Green, 
2007; Hyland, 1999, 2014; Hyland & Jiang, 2018; 
Hyland & Tse, 2004). 
The 
literature 
on 
academic 
writing 
acknowledges that the concept of metadiscourse 
brings to the fore structure of understanding 
academic discourse in writing (Crismore, 1983; 
Hyland, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015; 
Lautamatti, 1987; Matsuda & Tardy, 2007; Vande 
Kopple, 1985). Several cross-cultural studies (Adel, 
2006; Breivega et al., 2002; Vold, 2006), have shown 
that metadiscourse is not uniform across languages 
and is dependent on the way texts are written 
(Harwood, 2005; Hewings & Hewings, 2001). 
Additionally, previous studies that have adopted 
communicative purposes in genre-based studies of 
metadiscourse (Swales, 1990, 2004), have suggested 
that different genres and audiences may influence the 
use of metadiscourse. While there is a body of 
literature on different academic genres involving L1 
and L2 writers, there are little empirical studies, 
focused on emergent academic writers’ on-going and 
unpublished written works (Dobakhti & Hassan, 
2017; Hyland, 2015).  
 
This 
study 
focuses 
on 
disciplinary 
metadiscourse, as framed by the use of textual, 
engagement, and evaluative dimensions of academic 
discourse, used by emerging academic writers over 
time. Hence, the focus is on the first-year ESL 
doctoral students’ drafts of research proposals instead 
of edited works that have been published (e.g., 
research articles, books, textbooks) or completed 
(e.g., master and Ph.D. dissertations). This is due to 
the assumption that aspiring first-year ESL doctoral 
students’ on-going works, may offer insight on how 
the use of textual, engagement, and evaluative 
dimensions of academic discourse varies across time. 
This usually is between the first written draft to the 
final written draft, and between first-year ESL 
doctoral students, who work in different fields of 
education research. This article aims to offer insights 
into the way first-year ESL doctoral students 
organize texts. In doing so, this study highlights the 
importance of practicing disciplinary textual, 
engagement, and evaluative dimensions of academic 
discourse. Besides, this study invites discussion 
regarding the teaching of academic writing and ESP 
in institutes of higher education. The research 
question guided this study is: What are the 
similarities and differences of textual, engagement, 
and evaluative dimensions of academic discourse in 
writing used by first-year ESL doctoral students 
during their first year of doctoral studies?  
 
 
Metadiscourse 
Following 
the 
perspective 
of 
functional 
metadiscourse (Hyland, 2000; 2004; 2017), this study 
draws on Hyland’s conceptions of metadiscourse, 
which is defined as textual communication within an 
academic community. Functional metadiscourse 
refers to linguistic resources, that enable writers to 
use language with credibility in a given context 
(Hyland, 2000). To write with credibility and to use 
various features of language in an academic context, 
demands familiarity with readers and is played out 
through writers’ choice of language, with strategic 
employment of linguistic resources (Hyland, 2015,

2017; Hyland & Tse, 2004). Functional metadiscourse 
thus captures the basic principle of communication 
by emphasizing interactivity among ideational, 
interpersonal, and textual meaning (Hyland, 2005). 
Ideational refers to the writers’ voice while 
interacting with others and interpersonal refers to the 
way writers interact with readers in the expression of 
relationships and values. These two principles reflect 
the fundamental aspect of human interaction between 
writers and readers. The activity of writing in an 
academic context relates to the ways writers organize 
the messages that make sense to themselves as 
writers and to readers of the texts. These ideational, 
interpersonal, and textual meanings were part of 
Hyland’s (2000) metadiscourse model, which are 
especially significant to help writers make a 
connection with the imagined readers of a text.  
Hyland’s model of metadiscourse originally 
consists of two dimensions: textual dimension which 
refers to the organization of texts, while interpersonal 
dimension reflects the writer-reader relations. In the 
light of recognizing the interpersonal dimension, 
Hyland (2005) has put forth a view, claiming that, all 
metadiscourse categories are interpersonal, he 
proposed a change in terminology and adopted 
Thompson’s (2001) interactive dimension (instead of 
textual dimension) and interactional dimension 
(instead of interpersonal dimension). Due to this, 
Hyland’s (2004) model of metadiscourse consists of 
interactive and interactional dimensions. These two 
dimensions in Hyland’s (2004) model by its 
suggestion refers to interaction. In the metadiscourse 
model, engagement markers categories (e.g., writer-
oriented, reader-oriented, writer-reader oriented) are 
placed under the interactional dimension. However, 
in the modified model of metadiscourse used in this 
study, the textual dimension is adopted from 
Hyland’s (2000) model of metadiscourse and the 
interactional dimension is further divided into two 
dimensions: engagement and evaluative. The textual 
dimension that was used in this study refers to the 
writer’s effort to create his or her preferred 
interpretations. The reason for keeping Hyland’s 
(2000) terminology, textual dimension instead of 
interactive dimension is because the current study 
focuses on first-year ESL doctoral students’ 
development or changes of writing over time. This is 
usually happening between first written drafts to the 
final written drafts during their first year of doctoral 
studies. At the moment, readers’ involvement is 
limited because these drafts focus on the participants’ 
expression, as writers and their acts of drafting often 
involve their self-conceptions and perceptions. In 
contrast, research work on dissertation or journal 
articles are different, because they are meant for a 
group of readerships, which involve a certain degree 
of interaction between the writer and the reader. 
Furthermore, this study aims to explore, if these 
participants develop their writers’ identity overtime. 
The engagement dimension used in this study 
had 
been 
proposed 
in 
Hyland’s 
model 
of 
metadiscourse. In his metadiscourse model, the 
author integrated engagement markers categories 
under the interactional dimensions. However, in the 
modified model of metadiscourse, that was used in 
this study, makes the interactional dimension be 
further divided into two different dimensions: 
engagement and evaluative. These two dimensions in 
Hyland’s (2004) model, by its suggestion, refers to 
the writers’ efforts to anticipate readers’ knowledge 
and ‘involve readers in the argument by alerting them 
to 
the 
authors’ 
perspective 
towards 
both 
propositional information and readers themselves’ 
(p.168). However, the engagement dimension that is 
used in this study refers to writers’ engagement with 
self as writers. The decision to continue using the 
engagement dimension is proposed by Hyland, but 
the reason it was modified as a single dimension is 
that the participants’ experiences in drafting their 
doctoral research proposals are bound up with their 
dynamic self-perceptions. 
The evaluative dimension that is used in this 
study provides a direct association from the verb ‘to 
evaluate’ and the decision to adopt the term is based 
on the following views by Thompson (2001) and 
Hyland (2004). As noted by Thompson (2001), 
interactional involve assessment of the content, 
through evaluation by writer and reader while Hyland 
(2004)’s interactional dimension draws on evaluative 
features. For example, attitude markers (writers’ 
attitude); hedges (writers’ reluctance), and boosters 
(writers’ certainty). Although, the present study 
adopted the term, evaluative, evaluative dimension 
that is used in this study, refers to writers’ effort to go 
through the process of self-assessment (e.g., evaluate 
their writing by looking at other writers in his or her 
chosen field). This dimension thus relates to how 
writers position themselves, by looking at other 
writers’ work of similar discipline.  
This means the modified version for the current 
study includes three dimensions of academic 
discourse. These three dimensions are (1) textual, (2) 
engagement, and (3) evaluative. First, the textual 
dimension consists of five categories of resources 
namely transitions (e.g., and), evidential (e.g., 
according to), code glosses (e.g., such as), frame 
markers (e.g., first) and endophytic (e.g., namely). 
Transitions include mainly conjunctions, which are 
used to link words, while frame markers refer to text 
boundaries like sequences and stages. Endophorics 
refer to information from other texts, that facilitates 
readers’ comprehension, through reference to other 
materials (Hyland, 1998). This resource thus relates 
to evidential that, concerned with source reference 
from other texts and code glosses that helps readers 
to grasp the ideational information in other ways. 
Second, the engagement dimension consists of three 
categories of resources namely: writer-oriented 
markers (e.g., I, we), reader-oriented markers (e.g.,

274 
you), and writer-reader oriented markers (e.g., us, 
our). The engagement dimension is used to make 
explicit reference to either the writers or readers and 
to explicitly refer to the relationship that the writer 
attempts to build with the readers in the text. Third, 
the evaluative dimension consists of three categories 
of resources namely hedges (e.g., might, perhaps), 
boosters (e.g., in fact, definitely) and attitude markers 
(e.g., I agree). Hedges withhold writer’s full 
commitment to propositional information; boosters 
imply writers’ certainty of the propositional 
information, and attitude markers imply the writers’ 
attitude towards propositions. Table 1 below presents 
the metadiscourse model.

METHOD 
The study 
This study concerns the first-year ESL doctoral 
students’ academic written communication in 
academic writing. The target participants were all 
first-year ESL doctoral students from a leading 
institution in Malaysia. All participants were at the 
stage of preparing a full research proposal as part of 
their doctoral studies, during the two-semester 
conditional enrolment period. Nevertheless, the 
participants’ age and background experiences were 
not sought to be a determinant for selection. Data was 
collected from the participants who had registered in 
2019 across four areas of study in the field of 
education at an established Malaysian institution. 
These participants were involved in all the four areas 
of study in the education field, which are: (i) 
curriculum and instructional technology (CIT), (ii) 
educational management, planning and policy 
(EMPP), (iii) educational psychology and counseling 
(EPC), and (iv) language and literacy education 
(LALE). All written drafts of their research 
proposals, encompassing the introduction, literature 
review, and methodology chapters were collected as 
data. 
 
Corpus 
The corpus analyzed in this study encompass 43 
drafts of research proposals, which total 64,500 
words altogether. Each participant provided about six 
to seven drafts of the research proposal, during the 
conditional enrolment period of one year. The reason 
for collecting these first-year ESL doctoral students’ 
written drafts of their research proposals, during their 
first year of doctoral studies was to explore the ways 
emergent academic writers use metadiscourse to 
organize texts. These written drafts were not edited 
or completed works that have been published. This 
means that these written drafts are the products 
produced in different stages of the writing process 
and includes a change element, to how the use of 
textual, engagement and evaluative dimensions of 
academic discourse in writing varies across time 
between first written drafts to the final written drafts, 
and between first-year ESL doctoral students who 
engage in different fields of education research. 
 
Data analysis 
A quantitative design with a corpus-based approach 
comprising 
general 
distribution, 
density, 
and 
frequency counts was employed. By doing so, it 
highlights the ways first-year ESL doctoral students 
who are writing in different areas of educational 
research use metadiscourse, for example, identifying 
and comparing the variations of metadiscourse used 
across time, and noting signs of change in the three 
dimensions 
of 
academic 
discourse 
(textual, 
engagement and evaluative) in writing. In examining 
the frequency of textual, engagement and evaluative 
dimensions of academic discourse, AntConc Build 
3.4.3 software developed by Anthony (2014) was 
used. All drafts were analyzed by looking at all items

in the context. This process consisted of repeatedly 
reading each draft until all relevant textual, 
engagement, and evaluative items were categorized. 
Once all the items had been categorized, the 
distribution, occurrences, and density of each 
dimension were calculated. Each item was then re-
examined carefully, in its original contexts. Finally, a 
final figure was calculated in proportion per 1,000 
words, to facilitate comparison among the drafts of 
research proposal across four areas of study in the 
field of education. 
 
 
RESULTS  
This study provides insights into the ways first-year 
ESL doctoral students use disciplinary metadiscourse 
to engage in their field of research and an exploration 
into the ways they organize texts across time between 
first written drafts to final written drafts. The results 
of the calculation are presented in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and 6. The first section would present the overall 
frequency of textual, engagement, and evaluative 
dimensions, followed by a detailed tabulation of 
findings for each of the four areas of study in 
education.

Overall, the highest total frequency was the 
textual dimension (4325/85.6%) followed by the 
evaluative dimension (571/11.3%), while that of the 
engagement dimension was third (156/3.1%) (see 
Table 2). The strong use of textual dimension may 
reflect that first-year ESL doctoral students wanted to 
negotiate the academic language and literacy 
demands in an ESL context. This is because they are 
required to write in a second language or they were 
likely to present their increased level of certainty as 
these textual dimensions were commonly used in 
scholarly academic writing (Hyland, 2004). In the 
textual dimension, it was also evident from the 
frequency counts that the evidential category was the 
highest compared to other categories. This is far more 
use of evidential, by first-year ESL doctoral students, 
and it may indicate the importance of citation in 
academic writing, as it helps to justify an argument 
and demonstrates the writers’ position (Hyland, 
2004). 
In contrast, the findings showed that the 
engagement dimension (3.1%) was the lowest of all 
three dimensions. This 3.1% indicates the rare 
occurrence of this engagement dimension in first-
year ESL doctoral students’ research proposal 
writing. The participants of the present study showed 
a considerably low use for engagement dimension 
than writers of other studies (Hyland & Tse, 2004; 
Kuhi & Behnam, 2011). These participants used only 
3.1%, which was less than first-year ethnic Chinese 
university students from different faculties and 
schools in Ho and Li (2018)’s study, the first-year L1 
and L2 undergraduate students in Lee and Deakin 
(2016), the final-year L1 Mandarin undergraduates in 
Li and Wharton (2012). These past studies also found 
low use of engagement dimensions in the students’ 
academic writing. However, the difference between 
these past studies and the current study is that they 
involved different groups of writers: undergraduates 
and first-year doctoral students.  
There is another important point to consider as 
low-level usage of engagement dimension may also 
indícate that first-year ESL doctoral students were 
less experienced in promoting their voice as 
academic writers. This is also plausible as first-year 
ESL doctoral students, do not have a clear 
disciplinary understanding of their areas of studies 
yet and as a result, they may face equal or more 
difficulties to write their doctoral research proposals. 
In simple terms, when students are uncertain about 
their disciplinary knowledge, they may attempt to 
present themselves as credible writers by using more 
evidential in their writing. They become more 
dependent and concerned about the event of citation 
instead of critically present an argument in their 
doctoral research proposal writing. Thus, this may 
indicate that first-year ESL doctoral students were 
most likely unable to explore an issue as the writer

with their reader ‘as an equal, a conversationalist 
partner’ (Kuhi & Behnam, 2011, pp.103). 
As shown in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 below, the 
first-year ESL doctoral students used far more textual 
dimension, than engagement and the evaluative 
dimensions of academic discourse in their research 
proposal writing. Specifically, the evidential (46%) 
and transition (18%) categories were the most 
frequent metadiscourse resources used. This use of 
evidential provides some support for several 
researchers’ (Hyland, 2004; Hyland & Tse, 2004; 
Kuhi & Behnam, 2011) arguments that doctoral 
students are more invested in establishing their 
academic credentials in academic writing (Hyland & 
Tse, 2004; Kuhi & Behnam, 2011), and in 
constructing a ‘skilled writer identity’ (Hyland, 2004, 
pp.142). In other words, evidential could contribute 
to the understanding of an argument by helping 
readers to distinguish who is responsible for a 
position in the argument. These findings lend support 
to previous studies by Kuhi and Behnam (2011), 
where their study reported the high usage of 
evidential and transitions, but in a different type of 
corpus. The high frequency of evidential was found 
in the handbook, while the transition was in a 
scholarly textbook chapter. As highlighted by Kuhi 
and Behnam (2011), this high usage for both 
evidential and transition reflected two unique 
qualities in terms of the target audience and 
institutional roles. These two qualities will be 
discussed in the discussion section below. 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION  
The overall frequency of textual, engagement, and 
evaluative dimensions from the findings suggest that 
textual dimension are highly regular phenomena in 
terms of metadiscourse resources. It had been found 
that the textual dimension (85.6%) of academic 
discourse employed in writing was more than the 
other two dimensions of academic discourse: 
engagement (11.3%) and evaluative (3.1%) across 
four areas of study in education. These findings can 
perhaps, partly be explained by the fact doctoral 
research proposal writing, regardless of studying 
major is concerned with texts organization. This text 
organization owes a great deal to writers’ clear 
conception of negotiating meaning in academic 
writing (Hyland, 2000, 2005). In other words, if this 
process of negotiation for meaning is done with 
limited 
knowledge 
of 
textual 
metadiscourse 
resources, it might affect writers’ flow of argument, 
intention, and voice in writing. 
Another feature from the findings that worth 
reporting here, was the high use of evidential, 
representing the textual dimension. Evidential was 
used consistently by all participants across the four 
areas of study in education. This consistent usage of 
evidential reflects the critical importance of 
establishing their academic credentials, in academic 
writing (Hyland & Tse, 2004; Kuhi & Behnam, 
2011), and in constructing a ‘skilled writer identity’ 
(Hyland, 2004, pp.142). While the findings show 
that, the use of evidential by all participants is 
consistent. However, the frequency variations are 
different from drafts from educational management, 
planning, and policy, the highest (68%) and language 
and literacy education, the lowest (23%). It is 
important to stress that, the frequency variations 
found in this study do not suggest that, the field is 
different nor the academic practice, but, it is more of 
how the participants as writers choose to position 
themselves, and in constructing their academic 
credentials that appeal to their chosen fields of 
research.  
On the other hand, the usage of transitions from 
the textual dimension found in the drafts is also 
relatively high compared to all the other categories of 
metadiscourse resources. In fact, it is the second-
highest (18%), followed by evidential (46%). 
Transition is a key way for writers to address the 
topic and demonstrate their reasoning in writing 
(Hyland & Tse, 2004). This trait is important in 
academic writing because it helps writers to rethink 
their arguments and navigate their directions in 
choosing the best position to represent themselves in 
writing. It has also been found that high usage of 
evidential and transitions reflect unique qualities, in 
terms of the target audience and institutional roles 
(Kuhi & Behnam, 2011). These two qualities could 
be explained in this study from two perspectives.

Second, these doctoral students’ drafts are 
written mainly for doctoral programs and higher 
education. Therefore, these writers may not use non-
academic language and employ features of academic 
writing. However, it is important to highlight that, as 
much as the institutional role may display complex 
qualities in how these writers should write 
academically, it does not foreground the idea that 
they 
can 
employ 
disciplinary 
metadiscourse 
effectively in writing. Also, they may not be aware of 
its function or practice of textual, engagement, and 
the evaluative dimension of academic discourse in 
the writing process. Moreover, their usage of 
disciplinary metadiscourse in academic writing could 
be contributed by their writing experiences and 
practices, and disciplinary knowledge. In a broad 
sense, these writers themselves might serve as their 
resources in how they use disciplinary metadiscourse 
to draft their doctoral research proposals.  
Next, the engagement dimension was found to 
be the lowest (3.1%) of all three dimensions. This low 
use of engagement dimension generally reflects the 
participants’ uncertainties, in terms of engagement 
with self as writers. These participants are likely 
facing challenges with information processing and in 
unfolding their interpretations while drafting their 
research proposals. This finding also lends support to 
other studies with the view that writers in the 
university are less experience in employing 
engagement metadiscourse resources in academic 
writing (see Ho & Li, 2018; Lee & Deakin, 2016). 
However, it is important to highlight the distinction 
between these previous studies and the current study, 
which is a different group of writers. The previous 


## Page 8

278 
studies involved undergraduates, while the current 
study focuses on first-year doctoral students. In this 
case, undergraduates may be less invested to enter the 
academic community, promote themselves as 
academic writers, or to engage with self as writers, 
during the writing process. First-year doctoral 
students, on the other hand, could have been more 
interested, than the undergraduates to announce their 
presence and construct their identity as academic 
writers, particularly, those who are looking forward 
to a career in academia. While these may delineate 
the differences between these two groups of writers, 
the first-year doctoral students raised the issue of 
disciplinary 
knowledge 
and 
familiarity 
with 
disciplinary metadiscourse which they might not 
develop yet, and their experiences in academic 
writing may be insufficient for them to represent 
themselves explicitly in academic writing. This may 
help to explain the underuse of engagement 
dimensions between these two groups of writers.  
The findings in this study also confirm that the 
metadiscoursal 
occurrence 
for 
the 
evaluative 
dimension of academic discourse varies in the drafts 
across four areas of study in education. In particular, 
drafts from the curriculum and instructional 
technology (CIT) (average density: 0.06), and 
educational management, planning, and policy 
(EMPP) (average density: 0.05) employed more 
evaluative dimension of academic discourse in 
writing, compared to the other areas of study in 
education (see Table 3 and 4). The high usage of the 
evaluative dimension may be due to the fact that 
students in the EMPP areas of study are required to 
evaluate policy, while CIT students are required to 
perform curriculum evaluation. For such reasons, 
hedges, boosters, and attitude markers in the 
evaluative dimension of academic discourse play a 
more visible role in CIT and EMPP field of study, as 
these writers are expected to negotiate shifting 
certainties, opinions, and claims (Hyland, 2004). 
Given this, it is evident that the frequency of the 
evaluative dimension differs across areas of study, 
but it has to be noted that, the different areas of study 
do not cause metadiscoursal occurrences. Instead, it 
is more about the way students engage with their 
chosen fields of research that is different. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
From the findings, it could be concluded that written 
discourse is formal in nature and foster minimal 
direct communication and interaction between the 
writer and the reader. The findings also revealed that 
textual realizations of interpersonal and rhetorical 
elements are critical in shaping the discourse of the 
academy, and in ensuring successful academic 
writing (Hyland, 2014; Hyland & Jiang, 2018). It is 
for this reason that, awareness and understanding of 
disciplinary metadiscourse frame by the use of 
textual, engagement, and evaluative dimensions of 
academic discourse are important in academic 
writing. In terms of types, frequency, and patterns of 
using 
textual, 
engagement, 
and 
evaluative 
dimensions by first-year ESL doctoral students 
across four areas of study in the field of education, 
are almost similar. The frequency (from most to least 
used) for textual dimension: EPC – EMPP – CIT – 
LALE; engagement dimension: EMPP – CIT – 
LALE – EPC, and evaluative dimension: CIT – 
EMPP – LALE – EPC. Indeed, these differences have 
important implications for understanding the process 
of academic writing particularly, in response to the 
writers’ evaluation of their written works, how 
changes of disciplinary metadiscourse usage take 
place, and factors that might affect their rhetorical 
decisions and textual realization. It is also interesting 
to stress that, writers’ usage of these three dimensions 
of metadiscourse can be influenced, by the field of 
study they engage in to carry out the different 
communicative functions in academic writing. 
However, it should be emphasized that this does not 
propose that, the field practice is different, but it is 
more of how the participants use the three 
dimensions: textual, engagement, and evaluative to 
engage in their chosen fields of research.  
There is another important point to consider, 
this study has shown that the frequency of all three 
dimensions of academic discourse differs from all 
participants, during their first year of doctoral studies. 
More importantly, it shows change and development 
in terms of metadiscourse usage. For example, the 
frequency of textual, engagement, and evaluative 
dimensions of academic discourse across four areas 
of study in education changes across time. These 
changes occur from first written drafts to the final 
written drafts. These are first-year ESL doctoral 
students, who are writing in different fields of 
research. Here, it is clear that the different contexts, 
social meaning, and doctoral students’ varied literacy 
practices, may have contributed to how the drafts 
were written to have different metadiscoursal 
occurrences. However, this change can also be due to 
the doctoral students’ desire as writers to establish 
their academic credentials and position themselves 
within the academic community (Hyland, 2004). 
While it is true that, rhetorical decisions and textual 
realization depend on the ways writers negotiate their 
meaning in written texts is closely link to their chosen 
disciplines, further studies should look at how this 
usage of disciplinary metadiscourse changes and 
affects the development of writing overtime is 
needed. 
This study relating to first-year ESL doctoral 
students’ use of disciplinary metadiscourse, as well 
as, their development or changes in writing over time 
that has offers new insights, on how the three 
dimensions of metadiscourse shape the writers’ 
propositions, and on the construction of writer’s 
identity over time. Though these aspects were not 
explored in detail in this article, the findings of the

study were in line with the metadiscourse concern, 
which points to the role of ‘unpacking the decisions 
that writers make in creating a discourse by itself’ 
(Hyland, 2004, pp. 140). This study is situated in 
doctoral students' drafts of the research proposal, for 
one year during their doctoral studies, instead of 
edited works that have been published. As such, the 
ideas presented here have the potential to be explored 
further and this may also support our teaching and 
learning of writing in university. This is, useful ways 
of assisting doctoral students, towards practices of 
disciplinary academic writing, and in constructing 
their writers’ identity. 
In conclusion, this research addressed specific 
questions about how first-year ESL doctoral students 
in the field of education employ textual, engagement, 
and evaluative dimensions of academic discourse, 
while writing their first year of doctoral studies. As 
noted by Hyland and Tse (2004), successful writing 
requires writers to perform communicative functions 
in texts. Such a notion asserts that the more writers 
are aware of the disciplinary metadiscourse 
functions, and understand its usage, the better the 
writers can present their arguments and achieve 
effective communication in academic writing. It is 
for this reason, disciplinary metadiscourse remains 
an indispensable model for the teaching and learning 
of academic writing and English for Specific 
Purposes (ESP) in university (Bhatia, 2014; Coffin, 
Curry, Goodman, Hewings, Lillis & Swann, 2005; 
Evans & Green, 2007; Hyland, 1999, 2014; Hyland 
& Tse, 2004; Hyland & Jiang, 2018). As such, this 
study has practical and pedagogical implications for 
the 
teaching 
and 
learning 
of 
disciplinary 
metadiscourse, with a focus on explicit explanation, 
demonstration, and practice of its usage and 
development in the academic writing process.
