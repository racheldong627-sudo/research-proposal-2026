Abstract
Over the last four decades, studies have investigated the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education. A 
recent prominent AI-powered technology that has impacted the education sector is ChatGPT. This article provides a 
systematic review of 14 empirical studies incorporating ChatGPT into various educational settings, published in 2022 
and before the 10th of April 2023—the date of conducting the search process. It carefully followed the essential steps 
outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines, as well 
as Okoli’s (Okoli in Commun Assoc Inf Syst, 2015) steps for conducting a rigorous and transparent systematic review. In 
this review, we aimed to explore how students and teachers have utilized ChatGPT in various educational settings, as well 
as the primary findings of those studies. By employing Creswell’s (Creswell in Educational research: planning, conduct-
ing, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research [Ebook], Pearson Education, London, 2015) coding techniques 
for data extraction and interpretation, we sought to gain insight into their initial attempts at ChatGPT incorporation 
into education. This approach also enabled us to extract insights and considerations that can facilitate its effective and 
responsible use in future educational contexts. The results of this review show that learners have utilized ChatGPT as a 
virtual intelligent assistant, where it offered instant feedback, on-demand answers, and explanations of complex topics. 
Additionally, learners have used it to enhance their writing and language skills by generating ideas, composing essays, 
summarizing, translating, paraphrasing texts, or checking grammar. Moreover, learners turned to it as an aiding tool to 
facilitate their directed and personalized learning by assisting in understanding concepts and homework, providing 
structured learning plans, and clarifying assignments and tasks. However, the results of specific studies (n = 3, 21.4%) 
show that overuse of ChatGPT may negatively impact innovative capacities and collaborative learning competencies 
among learners. Educators, on the other hand, have utilized ChatGPT to create lesson plans, generate quizzes, and pro-
vide additional resources, which helped them enhance their productivity and efficiency and promote different teaching 
methodologies. Despite these benefits, the majority of the reviewed studies recommend the importance of conducting 
structured training, support, and clear guidelines for both learners and educators to mitigate the drawbacks. This includes 
developing critical evaluation skills to assess the accuracy and relevance of information provided by ChatGPT, as well as 
strategies for integrating human interaction and collaboration into learning activities that involve AI tools. Furthermore, 
they also recommend ongoing research and proactive dialogue with policymakers, stakeholders, and educational prac-
titioners to refine and enhance the use of AI in learning environments. This review could serve as an insightful resource 
for practitioners who seek to integrate ChatGPT into education and stimulate further research in the field.

1  Introduction
Educational technology, a rapidly evolving field, plays a crucial role in reshaping the landscape of teaching and learn-
ing [82]. One of the most transformative technological innovations of our era that has influenced the field of education 
is Artificial Intelligence (AI) [50]. Over the last four decades, AI in education (AIEd) has gained remarkable attention 
for its potential to make significant advancements in learning, instructional methods, and administrative tasks within 
educational settings [11]. In particular, a large language model (LLM), a type of AI algorithm that applies artificial neural 
networks (ANNs) and uses massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content that 
is almost difficult to differentiate from human creations [79], has opened up novel possibilities for enhancing various 
aspects of education, from content creation to personalized instruction [35]. Chatbots that leverage the capabilities of 
LLMs to understand and generate human-like responses have also presented the capacity to enhance student learning 
and educational outcomes by engaging students, offering timely support, and fostering interactive learning experiences 
[46].
The ongoing and remarkable technological advancements in chatbots have made their use more convenient, increas-
ingly natural and effortless, and have expanded their potential for deployment across various domains [70]. One promi-
nent example of chatbot applications is the Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, known as ChatGPT, which was 
introduced by OpenAI, a leading AI research lab, on November 30th, 2022. ChatGPT employs a variety of deep learning 
techniques to generate human-like text, with a particular focus on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Long short-term 
memory (LSTM) allows it to grasp the context of the text being processed and retain information from previous inputs. 
Also, the transformer architecture, a neural network architecture based on the self-attention mechanism, allows it to ana-
lyze specific parts of the input, thereby enabling it to produce more natural-sounding and coherent output. Additionally, 
the unsupervised generative pre-training and the fine-tuning methods allow ChatGPT to generate more relevant and 
accurate text for specific tasks [31, 62]. Furthermore, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a machine 
learning approach that combines reinforcement learning techniques with human-provided feedback, has helped improve 
ChatGPT’s model by accelerating the learning process and making it significantly more efficient.
This cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) tool is widely recognized as one of today’s most advanced LLMs-
based chatbots [70], allowing users to ask questions and receive detailed, coherent, systematic, personalized, convincing, 
and informative human-like responses [55], even within complex and ambiguous contexts [63, 77]. ChatGPT is considered 
the fastest-growing technology in history: in just three months following its public launch, it amassed an estimated 120 
million monthly active users [16] with an estimated 13 million daily queries [49], surpassing all other applications [64]. 
This remarkable growth can be attributed to the unique features and user-friendly interface that ChatGPT offers. Its intui-
tive design allows users to interact seamlessly with the technology, making it accessible to a diverse range of individu-
als, regardless of their technical expertise [78]. Additionally, its exceptional performance results from a combination of 
advanced algorithms, continuous enhancements, and extensive training on a diverse dataset that includes various text 
sources such as books, articles, websites, and online forums [63], have contributed to a more engaging and satisfying 
user experience [62]. These factors collectively explain its remarkable global growth and set it apart from predecessors 
like Bard, Bing Chat, ERNIE, and others.
In this context, several studies have explored the technological advancements of chatbots. One noteworthy recent 
research effort, conducted by Schöbel et al. [70], stands out for its comprehensive analysis of more than 5,000 studies on 
communication agents. This study offered a comprehensive overview of the historical progression and future prospects

Review
of communication agents, including ChatGPT. Moreover, other studies have focused on making comparisons, particularly 
between ChatGPT and alternative chatbots like Bard, Bing Chat, ERNIE, LaMDA, BlenderBot, and various others. For example, 
O’Leary [53] compared two chatbots, LaMDA and BlenderBot, with ChatGPT and revealed that ChatGPT outperformed both. 
This superiority arises from ChatGPT’s capacity to handle a wider range of questions and generate slightly varied perspec-
tives within specific contexts. Similarly, ChatGPT exhibited an impressive ability to formulate interpretable responses that 
were easily understood when compared with Google’s feature snippet [34]. Additionally, ChatGPT was compared to other 
LLMs-based chatbots, including Bard and BERT, as well as ERNIE. The findings indicated that ChatGPT exhibited strong per-
formance in the given tasks, often outperforming the other models [59].
Furthermore, in the education context, a comprehensive study systematically compared a range of the most promising 
chatbots, including Bard, Bing Chat, ChatGPT, and Ernie across a multidisciplinary test that required higher-order thinking. The 
study revealed that ChatGPT achieved the highest score, surpassing Bing Chat and Bard [64]. Similarly, a comparative analysis 
was conducted to compare ChatGPT with Bard in answering a set of 30 mathematical questions and logic problems, grouped 
into two question sets. Set (A) is unavailable online, while Set (B) is available online. The results revealed ChatGPT’s superior-
ity in Set (A) over Bard. Nevertheless, Bard’s advantage emerged in Set (B) due to its capacity to access the internet directly 
and retrieve answers, a capability that ChatGPT does not possess [57]. However, through these varied assessments, ChatGPT 
consistently highlights its exceptional prowess compared to various alternatives in the ever-evolving chatbot technology.
The widespread adoption of chatbots, especially ChatGPT, by millions of students and educators, has sparked extensive 
discussions regarding its incorporation into the education sector [64]. Accordingly, many scholars have contributed to the 
discourse, expressing both optimism and pessimism regarding the incorporation of ChatGPT into education. For example, 
ChatGPT has been highlighted for its capabilities in enriching the learning and teaching experience through its ability to 
support different learning approaches, including adaptive learning, personalized learning, and self-directed learning [58, 
60, 91]), deliver summative and formative feedback to students and provide real-time responses to questions, increase the 
accessibility of information [22, 40, 43], foster students’ performance, engagement and motivation [14, 44, 58], and enhance 
teaching practices [17, 18, 64, 74].
On the other hand, concerns have been also raised regarding its potential negative effects on learning and teaching. These 
include the dissemination of false information and references [12, 23, 61, 85], biased reinforcement [47, 50], compromised 
academic integrity [18, 40, 66, 74], and the potential decline in students’ skills [43, 61, 64, 74]. As a result, ChatGPT has been 
banned in multiple countries, including Russia, China, Venezuela, Belarus, and Iran, as well as in various educational institu-
tions in India, Italy, Western Australia, France, and the United States [52, 90].
Clearly, the advent of chatbots, especially ChatGPT, has provoked significant controversy due to their potential impact on 
learning and teaching. This indicates the necessity for further exploration to gain a deeper understanding of this technology 
and carefully evaluate its potential benefits, limitations, challenges, and threats to education [79]. Therefore, conducting a 
systematic literature review will provide valuable insights into the potential prospects and obstacles linked to its incorpo-
ration into education. This systematic literature review will primarily focus on ChatGPT, driven by the aforementioned key 
factors outlined above.
However, the existing literature lacks a systematic literature review of empirical studies. Thus, this systematic literature 
review aims to address this gap by synthesizing the existing empirical studies conducted on chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, 
in the field of education, highlighting how ChatGPT has been utilized in educational settings, and identifying any existing 
gaps. This review may be particularly useful for researchers in the field and educators who are contemplating the integration 
of ChatGPT or any chatbot into education. The following research questions will guide this study:
•	 What are students’ and teachers’ initial attempts at utilizing ChatGPT in education?
•	 What are the main findings derived from empirical studies that have incorporated ChatGPT into learning and teaching?
2  Methodology
To conduct this study, the authors followed the essential steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) and Okoli’s [54] steps for conducting a systematic review. These included identify-
ing the study’s purpose, drafting a protocol, applying a practical screening process, searching the literature, extracting 
relevant data, evaluating the quality of the included studies, synthesizing the studies, and ultimately writing the review. 
The subsequent section provides an extensive explanation of how these steps were carried out in this study.

2.1  Identify the purpose
Given the widespread adoption of ChatGPT by students and teachers for various educational purposes, often without a 
thorough understanding of responsible and effective use or a clear recognition of its potential impact on learning and 
teaching, the authors recognized the need for further exploration of ChatGPT’s impact on education in this early stage. 
Therefore, they have chosen to conduct a systematic literature review of existing empirical studies that incorporate 
ChatGPT into educational settings. Despite the limited number of empirical studies due to the novelty of the topic, their 
goal is to gain a deeper understanding of this technology and proactively evaluate its potential benefits, limitations, 
challenges, and threats to education. This effort could help to understand initial reactions and attempts at incorporating 
ChatGPT into education and bring out insights and considerations that can inform the future development of education.
2.2  Draft the protocol
The next step is formulating the protocol. This protocol serves to outline the study process in a rigorous and transparent 
manner, mitigating researcher bias in study selection and data extraction [88]. The protocol will include the following 
steps: generating the research question, predefining a literature search strategy, identifying search locations, establishing 
selection criteria, assessing the studies, developing a data extraction strategy, and creating a timeline.
2.3  Apply practical screen
The screening step aims to accurately filter the articles resulting from the searching step and select the empirical studies 
that have incorporated ChatGPT into educational contexts, which will guide us in answering the research questions and 
achieving the objectives of this study. To ensure the rigorous execution of this step, our inclusion and exclusion criteria 
were determined based on the authors’ experience and informed by previous successful systematic reviews [21]. Table 1 
summarizes the inclusion and exclusion criteria for study selection.
2.4  Literature search
We conducted a thorough literature search to identify articles that explored, examined, and addressed the use of ChatGPT 
in Educational contexts. We utilized two research databases: Dimensions.ai, which provides access to a large number of 
research publications, and lens.org, which offers access to over 300 million articles, patents, and other research outputs 
from diverse sources. Additionally, we included three databases, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and ERIC, which contain 
relevant research on the topic that addresses our research questions. To browse and identify relevant articles, we used the 
following search formula: ("ChatGPT" AND "Education"), which included the Boolean operator "AND" to get more specific 
results. The subject area in the Scopus and ERIC databases were narrowed to "ChatGPT" and "Education" keywords, and 
in the WoS database was limited to the "Education" category. The search was conducted between the 3rd and 10th of 
April 2023, which resulted in 276 articles from all selected databases (111 articles from Dimensions.ai, 65 from Scopus, 
28 from Web of Science, 14 from ERIC, and 58 from Lens.org). These articles were imported into the Rayyan web-based 
system for analysis. The duplicates were identified automatically by the system. Subsequently, the first author manually 
reviewed the duplicated articles ensured that they had the same content, and then removed them, leaving us with 135 
unique articles. Afterward, the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the first 40 manuscripts were scanned and reviewed by

Review
the first author and were discussed with the second and third authors to resolve any disagreements. Subsequently, the 
first author proceeded with the filtering process for all articles and carefully applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
as presented in Table 1. Articles that met any one of the exclusion criteria were eliminated, resulting in 26 articles. After-
ward, the authors met to carefully scan and discuss them. The authors agreed to eliminate any empirical studies solely 
focused on checking ChatGPT capabilities, as these studies do not guide us in addressing the research questions and 
achieving the study’s objectives. This resulted in 14 articles eligible for analysis.
2.5  Quality appraisal
The examination and evaluation of the quality of the extracted articles is a vital step [9]. Therefore, the extracted articles 
were carefully evaluated for quality using Fink’s [24] standards, which emphasize the necessity for detailed descriptions 
of methodology, results, conclusions, strengths, and limitations. The process began with a thorough assessment of each 
study’s design, data collection, and analysis methods to ensure their appropriateness and comprehensive execution. The 
clarity, consistency, and logical progression from data to results and conclusions were also critically examined. Potential 
biases and recognized limitations within the studies were also scrutinized. Ultimately, two articles were excluded for 
failing to meet Fink’s criteria, particularly in providing sufficient detail on methodology, results, conclusions, strengths, 
or limitations. The review process is illustrated in Fig. 1.
2.6  Data extraction
The next step is data extraction, the process of capturing the key information and categories from the included studies. 
To improve efficiency, reduce variation among authors, and minimize errors in data analysis, the coding categories were 
constructed using Creswell’s [15] coding techniques for data extraction and interpretation. The coding process involves 
three sequential steps. The initial stage encompasses open coding, where the researcher examines the data, generates 
codes to describe and categorize it, and gains a deeper understanding without preconceived ideas. Following open 
coding is axial coding, where the interrelationships between codes from open coding are analyzed to establish more 
comprehensive categories or themes. The process concludes with selective coding, refining and integrating categories or 
themes to identify core concepts emerging from the data. The first coder performed the coding process, then engaged 
in discussions with the second and third authors to finalize the coding categories for the first five articles. The first coder 
then proceeded to code all studies and engaged again in discussions with the other authors to ensure the finalization 
of the coding process. After a comprehensive analysis and capturing of the key information from the included studies, 
the data extraction and interpretation process yielded several themes. These themes have been categorized and are 
presented in Table 2. It is important to note that open coding results were removed from Table 2 for aesthetic reasons, 
as it included many generic aspects, such as words, short phrases, or sentences mentioned in the studies.
2.7  Synthesize studies
In this stage, we will gather, discuss, and analyze the key findings that emerged from the selected studies. The synthesis 
stage is considered a transition from an author-centric to a concept-centric focus, enabling us to map all the provided 
information to achieve the most effective evaluation of the data [87]. Initially, the authors extracted data that included 
general information about the selected studies, including the author(s)’ names, study titles, years of publication, educa-
tional levels, research methodologies, sample sizes, participants, main aims or objectives, raw data sources, and analysis 
methods. Following that, all key information and significant results from the selected studies were compiled using 
Creswell’s [15] coding techniques for data extraction and interpretation to identify core concepts and themes emerging 
from the data, focusing on those that directly contributed to our research questions and objectives, such as the initial 
utilization of ChatGPT in learning and teaching, learners’ and educators’ familiarity with ChatGPT, and the main findings 
of each study. Finally, the data related to each selected study were extracted into an Excel spreadsheet for data process-
ing. The Excel spreadsheet was reviewed by the authors, including a series of discussions to ensure the finalization of this 
process and prepare it for further analysis. Afterward, the final result being analyzed and presented in various types of 
charts and graphs. Table 4 presents the extracted data from the selected studies, with each study labeled with a capital 
’S’ followed by a number.

country in the reviewed studies, respectively.
3.1.4  Study population and sample size
Four study populations were included: university students, university teachers, university teachers and students, and 
elementary school teachers. Six studies involved university students [S2], [S3], [S5] and [S6]-[S8]. Three studies focused 
on university teachers [S1], [S4], and [S6], while one study specifically targeted elementary school teachers [S11]. Addi-
tionally, four studies included both university teachers and students [S10] and [12–14], and among them, study [S13] 
specifically included postgraduate students. In terms of the sample size of the reviewed studies, nine studies included a 
small sample size of less than 50 participants [S1], [S3], [S6], [S8], and [S10]-[S13]. Three studies had 50–100 participants 
[S2], [S9], and [S14]. Only one study had more than 100 participants [S7]. It is worth mentioning that study [S4] adopted a 
mixed methods approach, including 10 participants for qualitative analysis and 110 participants for quantitative analysis.

Review
3.1.5  Participants’ familiarity with using ChatGPT
The reviewed studies recruited a diverse range of participants with varying levels of familiarity with ChatGPT. Five studies 
[S2], [S4], [S6], [S8], and [S12] involved participants already familiar with ChatGPT, while eight studies [S1], [S3], [S5], [S7], 
[S9], [S10], [S13] and [S14] included individuals with differing levels of familiarity. Notably, one study [S11] had participants 
who were entirely unfamiliar with ChatGPT. It is important to note that four studies [S3], [S5], [S9], and [S11] provided 
training or guidance to their participants before conducting their studies, while ten studies [S1], [S2], [S4], [S6]-[S8], [S10], 
and [S12]-[S14] did not provide training due to the participants’ existing familiarity with ChatGPT.

research and engaging in discussions with policymakers and stakeholders is indeed crucial for the successful integration 
of ChatGPT in education and to maximize the benefits for both educators and students [S1], [S6]-[S10], and [S12]-[S14].
6  Discussion
The purpose of this review is to conduct a systematic review of empirical studies that have explored the utilization of 
ChatGPT, one of today’s most advanced LLM-based chatbots, in education. The findings of the reviewed studies showed 
several ways of ChatGPT utilization in different learning and teaching practices as well as it provided insights and con-
siderations that can facilitate its effective and responsible use in future educational contexts. The results of the reviewed 
studies came from diverse fields of education, which helped us avoid a biased review that is limited to a specific field. 
Similarly, the reviewed studies have been conducted across different geographic regions. This kind of variety in geo-
graphic representation enriched the findings of this review.
In response to RQ1, "What are students’ and teachers’ initial attempts at utilizing ChatGPT in education?", the find-
ings from this review provide comprehensive insights. Chatbots, including ChatGPT, play a crucial role in supporting 
student learning, enhancing their learning experiences, and facilitating diverse learning approaches [42, 43]. This review 
found that this tool, ChatGPT, has been instrumental in enhancing students’ learning experiences by serving as a virtual 
intelligent assistant, providing immediate feedback, on-demand answers, and engaging in educational conversations. 
Additionally, students have benefited from ChatGPT’s ability to generate ideas, compose essays, and perform tasks 
like summarizing, translating, paraphrasing texts, or checking grammar, thereby enhancing their writing and language 
competencies. Furthermore, students have turned to ChatGPT for assistance in understanding concepts and homework, 
providing structured learning plans, and clarifying assignments and tasks, which fosters a supportive home learning 
environment, allowing them to take responsibility for their own learning and cultivate the skills and approaches essen-
tial for supportive home learning environment [26–28]. This finding aligns with the study of Saqr et al. [68, 69] who 
highlighted that, when students actively engage in their own learning process, it yields additional advantages, such 
as heightened motivation, enhanced achievement, and the cultivation of enthusiasm, turning them into advocates for 
their own learning.
Moreover, students have utilized ChatGPT for tailored teaching and step-by-step guidance on diverse educational 
topics, streamlining task and project completion, and generating and recommending educational content. This per-
sonalization enhances the learning environment, leading to increased academic success. This finding aligns with other 
recent studies [26–28, 60, 66] which revealed that ChatGPT has the potential to offer personalized learning experiences 
and support an effective learning process by providing students with customized feedback and explanations tailored to 
their needs and abilities. Ultimately, fostering students’ performance, engagement, and motivation, leading to increase 
students’ academic success [14, 44, 58]. This ultimate outcome is in line with the findings of Saqr et al. [68, 69], which 
emphasized that learning strategies are important catalysts of students’ learning, as students who utilize effective learn-
ing strategies are more likely to have better academic achievement.
Teachers, too, have capitalized on ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and efficiency, using it for creating 
lesson plans, generating quizzes, providing additional resources, generating and preplanning new ideas for activities, and 
aiding in answering students’ questions. This adoption of technology introduces new opportunities to support teaching 
and learning practices, enhancing teacher productivity. This finding aligns with those of Day [17], De Castro [18], and 
Su and Yang [74] as well as with those of Valtonen et al. [82], who revealed that emerging technological advancements

Review
have opened up novel opportunities and means to support teaching and learning practices, and enhance teachers’ 
productivity.
In response to RQ2, "What are the main findings derived from empirical studies that have incorporated ChatGPT into 
learning and teaching?", the findings from this review provide profound insights and raise significant concerns. Starting 
with the insights, chatbots, including ChatGPT, have demonstrated the potential to reshape and revolutionize education, 
creating new, novel opportunities for enhancing the learning process and outcomes [83], facilitating different learning 
approaches, and offering a range of pedagogical benefits [19, 43, 72]. In this context, this review found that ChatGPT could 
open avenues for educators to adopt or develop new effective learning and teaching strategies that can evolve with the 
introduction of ChatGPT into the classroom. Nonetheless, there is an evident lack of research understanding regarding 
the potential impact of generative machine learning models within diverse educational settings [83]. This necessitates 
teachers to attain a high level of proficiency in incorporating chatbots, such as ChatGPT, into their classrooms to create 
inventive, well-structured, and captivating learning strategies. In the same vein, the review also found that teachers with-
out the requisite skills to utilize ChatGPT realized that it did not contribute positively to their work and could potentially 
have adverse effects [37]. This concern could lead to inequity of access to the benefits of chatbots, including ChatGPT, 
as individuals who lack the necessary expertise may not be able to harness their full potential, resulting in disparities 
in educational outcomes and opportunities. Therefore, immediate action is needed to address these potential issues. 
A potential solution is offering training, support, and competency development for teachers to ensure that all of them 
can leverage chatbots, including ChatGPT, effectively and equitably in their educational practices [5, 28, 80], which could 
enhance accessibility and inclusivity, and potentially result in innovative outcomes [82, 83].
Additionally, chatbots, including ChatGPT, have the potential to significantly impact students’ thinking abilities, 
including retention, reasoning, analysis skills [19, 45], and foster innovation and creativity capabilities [83]. This 
review found that ChatGPT could contribute to improving a wide range of skills among students. However, it found 
that frequent use of ChatGPT may result in a decrease in innovative capacities, collaborative skills and cognitive 
capacities, and students’ motivation to attend classes, as well as could lead to reduced higher-order thinking skills 
among students [22, 29]. Therefore, immediate action is needed to carefully examine the long-term impact of 
chatbots such as ChatGPT, on learning outcomes as well as to explore its incorporation into educational settings 
as a supportive tool without compromising students’ cognitive development and critical thinking abilities. In the 
same vein, the review also found that it is challenging to draw a consistent conclusion regarding the potential of 
ChatGPT to aid self-directed learning approach. This finding aligns with the recent study of Baskara [8]. Therefore, 
further research is needed to explore the potential of ChatGPT for self-directed learning. One potential solution 
involves utilizing learning analytics as a novel approach to examine various aspects of students’ learning and sup-
port them in their individual endeavors [32]. This approach can bridge this gap by facilitating an in-depth analysis 
of how learners engage with ChatGPT, identifying trends in self-directed learning behavior, and assessing its influ-
ence on their outcomes.
Turning to the significant concerns, on the other hand, a fundamental challenge with LLM-based chatbots, 
including ChatGPT, is the accuracy and quality of the provided information and responses, as they provide false 
information as truth—a phenomenon often referred to as "hallucination" [3, 49]. In this context, this review found 
that the provided information was not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the utilization of chatbots presents 
potential concerns, such as generating and providing inaccurate or misleading information, especially for students 
who utilize it to support their learning. This finding aligns with other findings [6, 30, 35, 40] which revealed that 
incorporating chatbots such as ChatGPT, into education presents challenges related to its accuracy and reliability 
due to its training on a large corpus of data, which may contain inaccuracies and the way users formulate or ask 
ChatGPT. Therefore, immediate action is needed to address these potential issues. One possible solution is to equip 
students with the necessary skills and competencies, which include a background understanding of how to use it 
effectively and the ability to assess and evaluate the information it generates, as the accuracy and the quality of 
the provided information depend on the input, its complexity, the topic, and the relevance of its training data [28, 


## Page 16

49, 86]. However, it’s also essential to examine how learners can be educated about how these models operate, the 
data used in their training, and how to recognize their limitations, challenges, and issues [79].
Furthermore, chatbots present a substantial challenge concerning maintaining academic integrity [20, 56] and 
copyright violations [83], which are significant concerns in education. The review found that the potential misuse 
of ChatGPT might foster cheating, facilitate plagiarism, and threaten academic integrity. This issue is also affirmed 
by the research conducted by Basic et al. [7], who presented evidence that students who utilized ChatGPT in their 
writing assignments had more plagiarism cases than those who did not. These findings align with the conclusions 
drawn by Cotton et al. [13], Hisan and Amri [33] and Sullivan et al. [75], who revealed that the integration of chatbots 
such as ChatGPT into education poses a significant challenge to the preservation of academic integrity. Moreover, 
chatbots, including ChatGPT, have increased the difficulty in identifying plagiarism [47, 67, 76]. The findings from 
previous studies [1, 84] indicate that AI-generated text often went undetected by plagiarism software, such as 
Turnitin. However, Turnitin and other similar plagiarism detection tools, such as ZeroGPT, GPTZero, and Copyleaks, 
have since evolved, incorporating enhanced techniques to detect AI-generated text, despite the possibility of false 
positives, as noted in different studies that have found these tools still not yet fully ready to accurately and reliably 
identify AI-generated text [10, 51], and new novel detection methods may need to be created and implemented 
for AI-generated text detection [4]. This potential issue could lead to another concern, which is the difficulty of 
accurately evaluating student performance when they utilize chatbots such as ChatGPT assistance in their assign-
ments. Consequently, the most LLM-driven chatbots present a substantial challenge to traditional assessments [64]. 
The findings from previous studies indicate the importance of rethinking, improving, and redesigning innovative 
assessment methods in the era of chatbots [14, 20, 64, 75]. These methods should prioritize the process of evaluating 
students’ ability to apply knowledge to complex cases and demonstrate comprehension, rather than solely focusing 
on the final product for assessment. Therefore, immediate action is needed to address these potential issues. One 
possible solution would be the development of clear guidelines, regulatory policies, and pedagogical guidance. 
These measures would help regulate the proper and ethical utilization of chatbots, such as ChatGPT, and must be 
established before their introduction to students [35, 38, 39, 41, 89].
In summary, our review has delved into the utilization of ChatGPT, a prominent example of chatbots, in educa-
tion, addressing the question of how ChatGPT has been utilized in education. However, there remain significant 
gaps, which necessitate further research to shed light on this area.
7  Conclusions
This systematic review has shed light on the varied initial attempts at incorporating ChatGPT into education by both 
learners and educators, while also offering insights and considerations that can facilitate its effective and responsi-
ble use in future educational contexts. From the analysis of 14 selected studies, the review revealed the dual-edged 
impact of ChatGPT in educational settings. On the positive side, ChatGPT significantly aided the learning process in 
various ways. Learners have used it as a virtual intelligent assistant, benefiting from its ability to provide immedi-
ate feedback, on-demand answers, and easy access to educational resources. Additionally, it was clear that learners 
have used it to enhance their writing and language skills, engaging in practices such as generating ideas, composing 
essays, and performing tasks like summarizing, translating, paraphrasing texts, or checking grammar. Importantly, 
other learners have utilized it in supporting and facilitating their directed and personalized learning on a broad 
range of educational topics, assisting in understanding concepts and homework, providing structured learning 
plans, and clarifying assignments and tasks. Educators, on the other hand, found ChatGPT beneficial for enhancing 
productivity and efficiency. They used it for creating lesson plans, generating quizzes, providing additional resources, 
and answers learners’ questions, which saved time and allowed for more dynamic and engaging teaching strategies 
and methodologies.
However, the review also pointed out negative impacts. The results revealed that overuse of ChatGPT could 
decrease innovative capacities and collaborative learning among learners. Specifically, relying too much on Chat-
GPT for quick answers can inhibit learners’ critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Learners might not engage 
deeply with the material or consider multiple solutions to a problem. This tendency was particularly evident in group

Review
projects, where learners preferred consulting ChatGPT individually for solutions over brainstorming and collaborating 
with peers, which negatively affected their teamwork abilities. On a broader level, integrating ChatGPT into educa-
tion has also raised several concerns, including the potential for providing inaccurate or misleading information, 
issues of inequity in access, challenges related to academic integrity, and the possibility of misusing the technology.
Accordingly, this review emphasizes the urgency of developing clear rules, policies, and regulations to ensure 
ChatGPT’s effective and responsible use in educational settings, alongside other chatbots, by both learners and edu-
cators. This requires providing well-structured training to educate them on responsible usage and understanding its 
limitations, along with offering sufficient background information. Moreover, it highlights the importance of rethink-
ing, improving, and redesigning innovative teaching and assessment methods in the era of ChatGPT. Furthermore, 
conducting further research and engaging in discussions with policymakers and stakeholders are essential steps to 
maximize the benefits for both educators and learners and ensure academic integrity.
It is important to acknowledge that this review has certain limitations. Firstly, the limited inclusion of reviewed 
studies can be attributed to several reasons, including the novelty of the technology, as new technologies often face 
initial skepticism and cautious adoption; the lack of clear guidelines or best practices for leveraging this technol-
ogy for educational purposes; and institutional or governmental policies affecting the utilization of this technology 
in educational contexts. These factors, in turn, have affected the number of studies available for review. Secondly, 
the utilization of the original version of ChatGPT, based on GPT-3 or GPT-3.5, implies that new studies utilizing the 
updated version, GPT-4 may lead to different findings. Therefore, conducting follow-up systematic reviews is essential 
once more empirical studies on ChatGPT are published. Additionally, long-term studies are necessary to thoroughly 
examine and assess the impact of ChatGPT on various educational practices.
Despite these limitations, this systematic review has highlighted the transformative potential of ChatGPT in educa-
tion, revealing its diverse utilization by learners and educators alike and summarized the benefits of incorporating 
it into education, as well as the forefront critical concerns and challenges that must be addressed to facilitate its 
effective and responsible use in future educational contexts. This review could serve as an insightful resource for 
practitioners who seek to integrate ChatGPT into education and stimulate further research in the field.

The process of synthesizing the data presented in Table 4 involved identifying the relevant studies through a search 
process of databases (ERIC, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Dimensions.ai, and lens.org) using specific keywords "ChatGPT" 
and "education". Following this, inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied, and data extraction was performed using 
Creswell’s [15] coding techniques to capture key information and identify common themes across the included studies.
