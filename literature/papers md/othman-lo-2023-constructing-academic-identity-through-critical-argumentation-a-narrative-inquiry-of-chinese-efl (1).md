Constructing Academic Identity Through
Critical Argumentation: A Narrative
Inquiry of Chinese EFL Doctoral
Students’ Experiences
Juliana Othman1
and Yueh Yea Lo1
Abstract
This study aimed to explore the experiences of Chinese EFL doctoral students in constructing their academic identities
through critical argumentation in their thesis writing in an English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI) context. Data were col-
lected through semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Narrative analysis was used to examine participants’ thesis
writing to gain insights into their experiences of academic identity construction. The results revealed that Chinese EFL doc-
toral students face challenges in developing a critical voice and authorial position, synthesizing multiple sources, and position-
ing themselves rhetorically in their writing. Furthermore, the results open possibilities for a broader understanding of
academic writing that values international graduate student’s educational background and cultural diversity in target English
language discourse communities. While the narrative inquiry study on Chinese EFL doctoral students’ academic identity con-
struction through critical argumentation is insightful, there are several limitations to consider, mainly due to the small sample
size of only two female Chinese respondents.
Plain Language Summary
Constructing Academic Identity through Critical Argumentation
This study investigates how Chinese international doctoral students construct their academic identities by using critical
argumentation in their thesis writing within an English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI) setting. The researchers collected
data through semi-structured interviews and document analysis. In addition, they used narrative analysis to examine the
participants’ thesis writing and gain a deeper understanding of their experiences in developing their academic identities. The
study’s findings indicated that Chinese EFL doctoral students struggle to establish a critical voice and authorial position,
integrate multiple sources, and strategically position themselves in their written work. This means that they struggle to
express their opinions and ideas in their writing and use sources effectively to support their arguments. They also find it
challenging to position themselves as experts in their field. The results highlight the need for a more comprehensive
understanding of academic writing that considers international graduate students’ educational backgrounds and cultural
diversity in English language discourse communities. This means that academic writing instruction should be tailored to the
needs of students from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. The study has some limitations, particularly the small
sample size, which only includes two female Chinese participants. This means the findings may not be generalizable to
Chinese international doctoral students or students from other cultural and linguistic backgrounds.

Introduction
Recently, Malaysia has emerged as an increasingly sought-
after destination for postgraduate students from China,
owing to the internationalization of education. As of June
2021, over 20,000 registered Chinese students are studying
in Malaysia’s public and private higher education institu-
tions (Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Malaysia,
2021). Numerous Malaysian universities have implemented
EMI policies, given that English is a second language in
Malaysia. However, previous research (Singh, 2015, 2016)
has indicated that the crux of the international doctoral
scholars’ experience lies in dealing with various linguistic,
cultural, and institutional challenges, such as the need to
cultivate their academic identities through critical argu-
mentation in their academic discourse practices.
Critical argumentation and academic identity are indis-
pensable for intellectual growth and producing original
scholarship in a given discipline within higher education
and beyond (McKinley, 2015; Xu & Grant, 2020). In higher
education institutes where English as a Medium of
Instruction (EMI) is employed, such as Malaysia, critical
thinking is one of the essential prerequisites and desired
competencies. Doctoral students are expected to adopt a
well-established English academic discourse to achieve suc-
cessful academic writing standards and actively participate
in the EMI community. This adoption necessitates students
to demonstrate critical argumentation in their academic
writing and associated skills, such as evaluation and analy-
sis. However, students in EMI programs, particularly those
from cultures that practice different critical argumentation
values, may require assistance applying the Western critical
argumentation style in their English academic writing. Such
students often encounter difficulties articulating coherent
arguments and organizing their ideas, resulting in misunder-
standings and communication failures (Ai, 2017; McKinley,
2017; Wang & Parr, 2021; Wu & Buripakdi, 2021).
In the context of doctoral studies, thesis writing is
often perceived as a social learning space for construct-
ing students’ academic identity, as the research process
encourages them to engage in discussions to resolve dif-
ferences of opinion beyond the scope of their thesis
(Flowerdew & Wang, 2015; French, 2020; Mertkan &
Bayrakli, 2018). Scholars develop their social identities
textually by presenting themselves in accordance or at
odds with societal discourse as they appropriate and por-
tray these identities (Mantai, 2019; Teng, 2019; Pu &
Evans, 2018). These scholars suggest that academic iden-
tity develops over time and is constructed by the stu-
dent’s
educational
experiences.
Although
previous
studies (Wolfe, 2011; Zhang, 2017) have established that
critical argumentation is essential to higher education,
how doctoral students comprehend and experience criti-
cal argumentation while writing their doctoral theses and
constructing their academic identity still requires further
investigation. Only a few studies (Li & Deng, 2019; Pu &
Evans, 2018; Teng, 2019) have examined EFL doctoral
students’ critical argumentation and its impact on their
academic
identity
while
writing
their
theses.
Furthermore, while these studies have explored the cul-
tural factors that influence Chinese students’ academic
writing and critical argumentation skills, few have specif-
ically investigated how their prior educational experi-
ences and cultural values shape their construction of
academic identity through critical argumentation.
While there has been some research on academic iden-
tity construction among Chinese EFL doctoral students
in other contexts, such as their home universities in
China or Western universities, there is a significant gap
in the literature regarding their academic identity con-
struction in English as a second language setting, such as
Malaysia. Additionally, while critical argumentation has
been identified as an important aspect of academic writ-
ing, there has been limited exploration of its role in shap-
ing Chinese EFL doctoral students’ academic identities
in this context. Therefore, further investigation is needed
to understand how Chinese EFL doctoral students con-
struct their academic identities through critical argumen-
tation in an ESL setting.
This study examined two Chinese EFL doctoral stu-
dents’ experience in employing critical argumentation in
writing their thesis and academic identity development.
More specifically, the following research question is
addressed: What are the experiences of Chinese EFL
doctoral students in constructing their academic identi-
ties through critical argumentation in thesis writing?
EFL Doctoral Students and Critical
Argumentation Skill
According to Walton (2012), critical argumentation is a
process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating argu-
ments with the aim of influencing the thoughts and actions
of others. Wingate (2011) posits a three-part process for
constructing an argument: analysis and evaluation of con-
tent knowledge, development of the writer’s position, and
a coherent exposition. The first component involves the
writer’s ability to discern pertinent information from the
literature to support their point. The second component
requires the writer to articulate a well-considered position,
often conveyed through their voice or stance. Finally, the
2

third component necessitates the logical organization of
ideas at a structural level, commonly realized through the
academic essay or dissertation format.
Critical argumentation in academic writing is closely
linked to constructing academic identity in various ways.
First, critical argumentation requires the writer to engage
with complex ideas and concepts, which can contribute
to developing a sense of intellectual ownership. As doc-
toral students learn to express their own ideas and opi-
nions, they begin to see themselves as knowledgeable and
competent individuals in their respective fields. This sense
of academic confidence is a crucial aspect of academic
identity, as it allows students to establish themselves as
active contributors to the academic community.
Scholars (Baptista et al., 2015; Brodin, 2018) argued
that critical argumentation and academic identity are
highly relevant to doctoral thesis writing in seeking the
novelty of disciplinary value. Doctoral thesis writing is
viewed as a learning process for research and academic
writing that produces a sense of self by experimenting
with ideas. In doctoral thesis writing, students’ critical
argumentation competence is continually shaped and
developed by academic interactions (feedback process,
peer interaction, and academic networks; Akpur, 2020).
As such, doctoral thesis writing is seen as a critical process
that constitutes the writers’ understanding of who they
are, whom they aspire to be, and becoming a community
member of the discipline. Therefore, writing a doctoral
thesis remains challenging and should be discussed based
on critical argumentation and academic identity concepts.
Critical argumentation allows students to establish
their position as academic community members by
demonstrating their ability to engage with academic dis-
course. By engaging with the ideas and arguments of
other scholars in their field, doctoral students develop a
sense of belonging and begin to see themselves as part of
a larger academic community. This sense of belonging is
also a crucial aspect of academic identity. It helps doc-
toral students develop a sense of identity as academic
scholars connect to others in their field. In addition, criti-
cal argumentation allows students to construct their own
academic voice and develop a unique perspective on their
field of study. Students develop new insights and con-
tribute to new knowledge as they engage with existing
knowledge and challenge established ideas. This process
of constructing a unique academic voice is essential for
developing academic identity. It allows students to estab-
lish themselves as experts in their field and set themselves
apart from others who may hold similar qualifications.
Factors Affecting Critical Argumentation
Some
scholars
(Ramanathan
&
Atkinson,
1999;
Vandermensbrugghe, 2004) used cultural stereotypes to
explain the inadequacies in international students’ critical
argumentation. For instance, Chinese EFL students’ edu-
cational background and cultural factors can influence
their lack of critical argumentation in writing their thesis
in English. There are several reasons why this may be the
case. First, the Chinese education system traditionally
strongly emphasizes rote memorization and reproduction
of knowledge rather than critical argumentation and inde-
pendent inquiry (Tian & Low, 2011; Zhang, 2017). As a
result, Chinese students may have been exposed to a dif-
ferent level of critical argumentation in their previous aca-
demic experiences. Hence, they may struggle to develop
these skills when writing their thesis in English.
Moreover, China’s cultural values and norms influence
how Chinese students approach academic writing. In tra-
ditional Chinese culture, there is a strong emphasis on col-
lectivism, harmony, and avoiding conflict (Andrews,
2007; Zhang, 2017). These values may discourage Chinese
students from engaging in critical argumentation, as it can
be perceived as confrontational and may create tension
within the academic community. Additionally, the hier-
archical nature of Chinese society may also play a role in
inhibiting critical argumentation. In Chinese culture,
respect for authority and deference to elders is highly val-
ued. Chinese students’ apparent lack of critical argumen-
tation has been attributed to their deference to instructors
and scholars, where criticism can be interpreted as disre-
spectful (Andrews, 2007; Zhang, 2017). Thus, this defer-
ence may make Chinese students more hesitant to
challenge the ideas of established scholars and academics,
an essential aspect of critical argumentation.
Furthermore, the language barrier may also inhibit
critical argumentation (Rear, 2017; Manalo & Sheppard,
2016). Writing a thesis in a foreign language can be chal-
lenging, and Chinese students may struggle to express
their ideas in English as they would in their native lan-
guage. They might find it challenging to engage in critical
argumentation, as doing so might need more advanced
linguistic abilities.
In conclusion, Chinese EFL students’ educational back-
ground and cultural factors may influence their lack of crit-
ical argumentation in writing their thesis in English. The
traditional Chinese education system, cultural values and
norms, hierarchy, and the language barrier can all inhibit
the development of critical argumentation skills. Therefore,
addressing these factors and supporting Chinese EFL stu-
dents to develop these skills can be essential to their aca-
demic success and professional development.
Theoretical Context
Examining the influence of critical argument on EFL doc-
toral students’ academic identity construction requires a
theoretical framework that inspires a relationship between

critical argument academic identity. Doctoral students’
academic identity development could be understood
through Ivanic’s (1998) identity-building theory. Ivanic
(1998) expanded on the theory to describe how social and
cultural elements influence academic writer development,
which occurs in written discourse when a writer makes cer-
tain linguistic decisions in an effort to influence readers.
For EFL students, academic writer identity development
coincides with cultural identity development. Clark and
Ivanic (1997) reported that academic writers’ identities
manifested in their writing as various ‘‘selves’’ (autobiogra-
phical, authorial, or discoursal), which are used according
to the writer, task, and sociocultural component (Ivanic,
1998). The autobiographical self is the writer’s life story
and sense of self, including their background, cultural
beliefs, and inclinations. The discoursal self is the image a
writer deliberately or unconsciously presents in writing,
which is tied to the writer’s sense of self, values, beliefs,
and power relations in a social environment. The author-
ial self refers to how writers show themselves as authori-
tative in writing by presenting their thoughts and beliefs.
Possibilities for selfhood refer to the interaction between
a writer’s social-cultural background, institutional set-
ting, and disciplinary discourse, which can lead to form-
ing writer identities distinct from the autobiographical
self. The autobiographical and discursive selves can even-
tually lead to the creation of an authorial self, and the
possibilities for selfhood might impact how we perceive
ourselves. These identities are manifested by the writer’s
attempts to persuade the reader through various forms of
argumentation, which occurs in the final step of a writer’s
identity development. In academic writing, the authorial
self is a means of representing ideational and interperso-
nal meanings.
Critical argumentation influences a writer’s academic
identity construction that conforms to the academic dis-
course community value system by defending an author-
ial position. The concept of critical arguments states that
a debate results from an argument in jointly constructing
knowledge (Andrews, 2015; Wolfe, 2011). Regarding
academic writing, the identity-building theory is based
on the notion that writers create an argument with sev-
eral strategies and formats. Two possible approaches are
taking a position based on one’s schemata and support-
ing it with source information. Another approach is to
read widely first and establish a position decision based
on the evidence. Examples of different forms of critical
argumentation are deductive or inductive writing and the
use of an autobiographical, authorial, or discursive self
(Clark & Ivanic, 1997). Overall, Ivanic’s identity-building
theory provides a valuable lens to analyze the complex
and dynamic process of constructing academic identity
among Chinese EFL doctoral students in an EMI
context.
Methodology
This study employs a narrative inquiry approach that
explores the Chinese EFL doctoral students’ engagement
with critical argumentation in thesis writing and their aca-
demic identity development. According to Connelly and
Clandinin (2006, p. 375), narrative inquiry involves exam-
ining ‘‘experience as a story’’ and is primarily a means of
conceptualizing experience. As such, narrative research
emphasizes the individual and the idea that a life narrative
or biographical account can provide insight into one’s life.
This method is particularly well-suited to studying aca-
demic identity construction because it allows researchers
to capture the complex and often personal ways individu-
als make sense of their academic experiences.
Through narrative inquiry, researchers gather narra-
tives from participants and use them to interpret their
experiences of the world, with a focus on the three-
dimensional space of temporality, sociality, and place.
Hence, exploring the participants’ academic identity
involved examining three dimensions. The first dimen-
sion was time, which provided insights into their past
experiences and current practices. The participants in
this study shared narratives that described their past edu-
cational experiences in their home country and their
transition to the current academic program in Malaysia.
The second aspect of narrative inquiry focused on per-
sonal elements, revealing how the participants’ identities
as PhD thesis writers evolved and shifted within their
experiences and research practice. In this study, interviews
focused on participants’ personal and social aspects, with
questions designed to elicit their feelings and beliefs and
their interactions with supervisors’ feedback.
Lastly, the institutional and sociocultural environ-
ments were considered to investigate the influence of con-
text on the development of their academic writer identity.
Participants
This study involved two female Chinese EFL doctoral
students at the Faculty of Education of a public univer-
sity in Malaysia. The study involved a purposive sample
of Chinese EFL doctoral students who have completed at
least one semester of coursework and are currently work-
ing on their thesis. Purposive sampling helps enroll the
participants who may provide credible and rich informa-
tion on the subjects under consideration (Patton, 2002).
The EFL doctoral students in the education discipline
were selected for the study as they had to write their the-
sis in English. At the university, potential doctoral candi-
dates are required to meet a cut-off International English
Language Testing System (IELTS) score of 6.0 and hold
a recognized master’s degree with a minimum cumulative
grade point average (CGPA) of 3.0 to gain entry to the
doctoral studies in education.

Volunteers were recruited through targeted invitations
sent via WhatsApp and Telegram group chats and online
community platforms exclusively for doctoral students at
a Malaysian public university’s Faculty of Education.
Interested individuals were encouraged to contact the
researchers to schedule a face-to-face briefing on the
informed consent process and interviews. Initially, five
doctoral students (two males and three females) agreed
to participate, but three withdrew after the first inter-
view. The researchers investigated the reasons for with-
drawal and documented them thoroughly. All three (two
males and one female) participants cited scheduling con-
straints as their reason for discontinuing their involve-
ment in the study. They had requested a one-semester
postponement of their doctoral studies. In addition, the
two male participants had full-time jobs and financial
difficulties (self-funded PhD) that made it challenging to
continue their studies.
In contrast, the female participant cited her recent mar-
riage commitment. Prospective participants were given a
week to review the research information before deciding
whether to participate. Volunteers were informed of the
study’s purpose, data collection processes, time commit-
ment, and their right to privacy and anonymity. The two
students included in this study were selected as they met
the aforementioned descriptive criteria. Moreover, they
volunteered to participate in the study. They were willing
to reflect on their experiences writing their doctoral thesis
at a Malaysian university and how they progressed
through the course 1 year later. The primary premise of
sampling is that the informants can provide first-hand
accounts of EFL doctoral students’ thesis writing. The
pseudonyms Ming and Yuwei were used to protect the
students’ identities. The two students had completed a
master’s degree by coursework at an Australian and a uni-
versity in China. Ming has an IELTS score of 7.5, while
Yuwei scores band 7. At the time of the study, the stu-
dents had been in Malaysia for more than 6 months. The
two students were enrolled in a qualitative research meth-
odology course that focused heavily on the philosophical
underpinnings of this research approach.
The study received ethics approval from the university
where it was conducted. In addition, we obtain signed
informed consent from both participants and ensure that
their identities are protected through the use of pseudo-
nyms. We also ensure that the data collected is kept con-
fidential and used only for this study.
Data Collection
Data were collected through semi-structured interviews
and document analysis. The interviews aimed to explore
students’ experiences using critical argumentation in
their academic writing and how it is linked to their
academic identities. Each participant took part in two 1-
hour interviews. The initial interview, which was done at
the start of the research, was intended to understand the
participants’ educational background and academic writ-
ing experiences in their native language and EFL. The
main topics of the second interview session were how
they assumed their academic identity as doctoral stu-
dents and how they handled critical argumentation in
their thesis writing. This second interview also discussed
any potential sociocultural and personal factors influen-
cing their academic writing practices. During the inter-
views, the participants were encouraged to describe and
evaluate their own academic writing experiences from
their perspectives.
An interview protocol was employed for in-depth
interviews based on the existing instruments (Ivanic,
1998; Shang-Butler, 2015). All the interviews were con-
ducted face-to-face and recorded for transcription pur-
poses. The interviews were transcribed immediately, and
the researchers reviewed each transcription with written
notes from the interview while listening to the recording.
The document analysis was conducted 2 to 4 weeks
after the students had completed writing sections of their
thesis. Document analysis was used to examine partici-
pants’ thesis writing in order to gain insights into their
critical argumentation and rhetorical positioning. In
addition, they discussed their written texts and how they
exercised their agency to mediate their academic writing
and adapt to disciplinary practices.
Data Analysis
In this study, we adopted a narrative approach as the pri-
mary unit of analysis. The data collected from the partici-
pants were subjected to this analysis. This involved
examining each participant’s narrative structure, themes,
and discourse to identify patterns and gain insights into
their personal experiences of critical argumentation and
academic identity formation. An iterative inductive analy-
sis was conducted, whereby each narrative was scrutinized
without taking notes or discussing the stories with other
researchers. Each researcher independently analyzed each
narrative to determine key themes later discussed during a
subsequent meeting for a final joint perusal.
The analysis aimed to understand the narratives the
Chinese doctoral students shared by focusing on the dif-
ferences in their experiences rather than simplifying them
into one meaning. It is worth noting that narratives rep-
resent and interpret personal life experiences, as stated by
Clandinin and Connelly (2000). The narrative analysis
was particularly fitting for this study, enabling the
researchers to identify common thematic elements across
the participants’ accounts and interpret their intended
meaning. Overall, the use of narrative analysis in this
Othman and Lo

study provided a powerful lens through which to explore
and understand the experiences of Chinese EFL doctoral
students concerning their critical argumentation and aca-
demic writer identity development in an EMI context.
Being small-scale and exploratory, we do not suggest
that the findings of this study will necessarily be repre-
sentative of Chinese EFL doctoral students’ experiences
in Malaysia or other countries. However, the interpreta-
tions reached in the study may shed some light on other
doctoral EFL students’ experiences in a similar context.
Findings
This narrative inquiry aimed to explore the experiences of
Chinese EFL doctoral students in constructing their aca-
demic identities through critical argumentation in an EMI
context. The findings suggest that critical argumentation in
doctoral thesis writing plays a vital role in shaping Chinese
EFL students’ academic identity construction. Three key
themes emerged through a narrative analysis of the inter-
view data: developing a critical voice, defending authorial
positions and constructing English rhetorical positioning.
Using our narrative approach, we start with two short
anecdotes to present Ming and Yuwei’s encounters with
critical argumentation while working on their theses.
Next, we will discuss how their thesis-writing process
influenced their academic identity development, explor-
ing the transformation and conflict between their previ-
ous interpretations of academic writing and disciplinary
requirements.
Ming’s Story
During the interview period, Ming, a 29-year-old first-year
PhD student, had recently commenced the second study
semester. In 2018, Ming completed a Master’s degree by
coursework in Australia and applied for a PhD program
in Malaysia. Ming was admitted as a doctoral student in
the summer of 2019. Ming originated from China and con-
sidered English a foreign language despite having received
training in English academic writing and educational expe-
rience in Australia for her Master’s degree. In the first
interview, Ming expressed a few preconceived beliefs about
doctoral thesis writing, acknowledging the need to enhance
the quality of writing to meet the doctoral-level criteria.
Owing to Ming’s exposure to English academic writing
and the educational system for the Master’s degree in an
EMI context, Ming was conscious that doctoral thesis
writing required extensive critical thinking.
Ming noted that numerous countries and universities
employ EMI-educated academic writing at different lev-
els, constituting a culture of analytical writing. ‘‘In
Australia, it was so common where we will need to critique
the work of others, whether it is discussion-based in class
or written work,’’ Ming remarked. Ming acknowledged
that the situation resembled her experience in Malaysia.
In class discussions or written work, critiquing the work
of others was also the norm in her doctoral program in
Malaysia. However, Ming perceived a greater emphasis
on critical thinking in the PhD thesis writing than in her
Master’s degree coursework. Ming viewed her Master’s
degree as merely a collection of coursework assignments,
whereas the PhD thesis required more in-depth analyti-
cal and evaluative skills. Ming added, ‘‘Critical discus-
sions in the classroom will suffice for a Master’s degree,
but now I need to develop critical argumentation in thesis
writing, which I was not required to do previously.’’ Ming
also expressed concerns about her thesis writing, specifi-
cally the lack of critical reasoning and positioning in her
English thesis writing.
Critical Argumentation: Developing Critical Voice and
Defending Authorial Position
During the discussion of her thesis, Ming demonstrated
comprehension and agreement with the reading materials
presented. Furthermore, she seemed to perceive critical
argumentation as the ability to acknowledge and endorse
diverse perspectives. Ming appeared to understand and
agree with everything she had read when discussing her the-
sis writing. To her, critical argumentation was related to
how she could agree with different views. Ming discussed
how she attempted to be critical, which is illustrated below:
I think all these professors’ view is correct, and I agree with
them. However, I really want to make a point in the face of
my agreeing to all these professors’ work. I know I must write
that what they said is correct, and I cannot say that it is not
correct.
Ming was unaware of what critical argumentation
entails in her writing and felt that she needed to obscure
her emerging voice and endeavors to position herself in
the text. Moreover, she believed critical argumentation
referred to agreeing with the authors cited in her claims.
For this reason, Ming’s strategy was to avoid confronta-
tion and preserve her view while simultaneously placing
herself in a more secure position. She referred to her crit-
ical argumentation with the following terms: ‘‘I agree
with.’’. ‘‘This is in agreement with.’’, and ‘‘We should.
as noted by.’’. Her linguistic choice appeared to indicate
the tension between her desire to construct an insider’s
identity in her discipline and her interpretation of the
disciplinary requirements. Thus, how Ming constructed
meaning revealed how she thought she could agree and
how she wanted to argue regulated her critical argumen-
tation. This insight acknowledged EFL students’ unfami-
liarity with critical argumentation culture.

In the quote mentioned above, Ming noted that she
struggled to comment on or criticize other researchers’
work as she was shaped by her admiration for the
experts’ ideas and fear of expressing herself against book
and journal authors. Ming elaborated on how she evalu-
ated the literature in the following excerpt:
I don’t dare to give my opinion or critique the authors who
have written and published so much. These are professors and
established authors. I feel not qualified to do so as a doctoral
student.
Ming felt compelled to follow established authors who
demonstrated what should be done. Therefore, in this
specific example of meaning-making, Ming experienced
challenges manifesting her presence, which is a critical
writing voice. Given Ivanic’s (1998) identity-building the-
ory, her avoidance of critiquing could have been due to a
lack of confidence in positioning her view in relation to
established authors or uncertainty about how she could
achieve a balance between others and expressing herself.
This finding highlighted how critiquing and presenting a
position requires a sense of power and control over the
reading text. Ming’s case indicated that doctoral students
might lack the power to develop a critical voice and
defend an authorial position in critical discourse within
the disciplinary community. Ming explained why she
refrained from critically commenting on others’ work in
the following excerpt:
In my culture, Chinese, we are not encouraged to challenge
authority. We show our respect for elders and high-ranking peo-
ple like professors. Professor is very knowledgeable, and I am
just a doctoral student. The professor is always right, you know.
Ming
revealed
that
Chinese
academic
practices
emphasized
respect
for
authority
and
scholarship.
Strikingly, Ming used ‘‘we’’ when referring to her com-
munity. It appeared that Ming adopted her Chinese dis-
coursal tradition or thoughts (way of thinking) either
consciously or unconsciously in her thesis writing.
Briefly, cultural elements appeared to influence her criti-
cal argumentation. She believed it was irrational to be
‘‘critical’’ of an authority, such as a book writer, who
was more knowledgeable than her. As she found criti-
quing challenging, Ming resorted to agreeing to multiple
views and tended to hide or neutralize her writer’s voice.
This ultimately undermined her critical voice and author-
ial position of having an opinion. Reflecting on her the-
sis writing challenges, Ming demonstrated more complex
perceptions of critical argumentation in the following
excerpt:
Yes, I took a master’s [degree], and the professor values criti-
cal argument, but we are not taught how to show it in writing.
So, it is very difficult for me to know what is that and to com-
ment or evaluate.
The preceding excerpt indicated that Ming’s critical
argumentation was hampered not due to cultural barriers
but because it was not explicitly taught in higher educa-
tion. It may have been more challenging for Ming as she
had not engaged in critical argumentation when pursuing
her
Master’s
degree
(coursework).
They
involve
a
research project and a series of taught modules delivered
through lectures and seminars. Moreover, her doctoral
studies involved embarking on a new and unfamiliar
research topic of which she needed more knowledge. This
challenge highlighted how the value of argumentation is
embedded in lecturers’ expectations, but it needs to be
explicitly taught as a component of doctoral students’
experiences (McKinley, 2015). In this case, Ming’s critical
argumentation was confined to retelling, comparing, or
contrasting other researchers’ work. Consequently, Ming
needed help to meet the demands of self-representation
to position herself within the academic community, proj-
ect her writing voice, and adopt an academic identity.
Ming’s account was compelling as her academic writer
identity development coincided with cultural identity
development and higher education discourse practices.
The previous excerpt provided valuable perspectives on
critical argumentation nature and practice in higher edu-
cation. The excerpt highlighted how culture could influ-
ence writing styles but is not considered a barrier to
critical skills acquisition and critical voice development.
Ming’s unfamiliarity with critical argumentation in thesis
writing was probably due to a lack of exposure to critical
argumentation structures or experience with developing
a clear and coherent argument. Her transformation
regarding critical argumentation was complex and multi-
layered in the attempt to express her critical voice and
defend her authorial position.
Yuwei’s Story
Yuwei was 27 years old and completed a Master’s degree
through coursework in China in 2018. In the same year,
she applied for a doctoral program in Malaysia and was
admitted as a doctoral student in 2019 despite having
limited experience in thesis writing. Yuwei mentioned
that she only wrote an academic project paper in her
Master’s degree program, which put her at a disadvan-
tage in the thesis-writing process. During the first inter-
view, Yuwei discussed the evolution of personal beliefs
on doctoral thesis writing before and after commencing
the PhD program. Before commencing the PhD pro-
gram, Yuwei regarded her English proficiency as ‘‘good
for students like me from China.’’ However, after com-
mencing the doctoral program in Malaysia, Yuwei
Othman and Lo

considered her ‘‘understanding of critical thinking and
academic writing skills’’ an obstacle. Yuwei felt inhibited
by her linguistic nuances and expression during thesis
writing, despite being comfortable with spoken English.
She also noted the disparities in English usage between
China and Malaysia, where English was more widely
employed outside the classroom in Malaysia.
In reflecting on the first year of doctoral studies in
Malaysia, Yuwei acknowledged that the experience was
relatively difficult. She struggled to cope with the English
as a medium of instruction (EMI) context and constantly
expressed that ‘‘PhD takes me into unknown space’’ and
‘‘feels so different from what I learned all these years.’’ She
described her doctoral studies in Malaysia as dissimilar
from her previous education experience in China, with
less focus on rote learning and more problem-based in
nature. As a result, Yuwei encountered difficulties in
synthesizing ideas and evaluating academic arguments,
which delayed her thesis writing progress and influenced
her adoption of academic identity. Despite these strug-
gles, Yuwei acknowledged the advantages of writing a
dissertation in an EMI context, allowing her to situate
herself outside her comfort zone, namely her native coun-
try and language, during thesis writing. She also regarded
her dissertation writing success in Malaysia as a stepping
stone in her personal development as an academic writer
while increasing her employability. Nevertheless, Yuwei
remained constantly concerned about her thesis writing
progress and publication as it was part of the PhD gra-
duation requirement of the public university.
Critical Argumentation: Construction of English
Rhetoric Positioning and Synthesizing Multiple Sources
In discussing critical argumentation in thesis writing,
Yuwei demonstrated a different approach to implement-
ing a critical stance compared to Ming. Yuwei’s critical
argumentation was linked to her attempts to reflect
Chinese rhetorical norms, which is shown in the follow-
ing excerpt:
I prefer to use Professor’s name to support my thesis writing.
After I write something, I am expected to present famous pro-
fessors in my field as evidence to prove my point. This will
make my writing more believable since there is another super-
ior to support it.
Yuwei’s approach to critical argumentation
was
dependent on what she thought she was expected to do.
She stated that she was exposed to using the words of
famous people or books as evidence as she was exposed
to Chinese expository essay writing. Her reasoning for
her approach, which was not apparent on the surface of
her thesis writing, was uncovered by exploring how she
thought she was (or was not) expected to demonstrate
this critical argumentation and how she struggled to do
so.
Elaborating on how she evaluated the literature,
Yuwei stated, ‘I refer to the professor or authorities to
advance my argument. it is sort of using the authorities
to promote trustworthiness.’ Therefore, in this specific
example of meaning-making, Yuwei self-positioned as a
writer who attempted to provide the perceived desired
response according to the voices she considered represen-
tative of doctoral thesis writing in previous essay-writing
experiences. Therefore, she demonstrated her Chinese
expository strategy by relying on authorities in the field
to allow her to promote the trustworthiness of her writ-
ing and convey her writer’s voice less directly to acade-
mia. This over-reliance on referencing famous writers to
advance an academic argument simultaneously obscured
her stance and undermined her efforts to construct the
identity of an authoritative and knowledgeable member
of her chosen field of study. Yuwei’s stance aligns with
Andrews’s (2007) argument that Confucius’s heritage
culture places great importance on respect for authority
and scholarship. As a result, novice writers tend to avoid
presenting their critical arguments before mastering their
field.
Yuwei revealed that this habit was influenced by the
Chinese collective way of thinking: ‘‘I should think in this
way and be taught to use this kind of strategy in Chinese
essay writing for years.’’ This response indicated that her
previous writing experiences and exposure were limited
to Chinese composition style and framing. The different
writing experiences Yuwei acquired in school and under-
graduate studies did not prepare her for the fact that
doctoral thesis writing style is different and adheres to
different
literary
conventions.
More
importantly,
Yuwei’s reliance on her previous writing style could be
specifically challenging for her to adopt the expected
writing practices in her current academic environment
and restrict her approach to critical argumentation.
According to Liu and Huang (2021), rhetorical aspects
in EFL academic writing are not considered as impor-
tant in the Chinese context. This may contribute to
Yuwei’s challenges in adapting to English academic writ-
ing conventions.
Yuwei explained that her approach to critical argu-
mentation was rooted in her prior literacy practices
(Chinese rhetorical strategy) and acknowledged that she
found it challenging to understand the rhetorical differ-
ences between Chinese and English in thesis writing.
While finding it challenging to compose the target dis-
course, Yuwei appeared to face barriers in negotiating
identities within two selfhoods. She viewed the Chinese
and English writer’s selfhoods as a conflict between two
positions and preferred identities. This conflict resulted

in her struggling to engage in critical argumentation and
writing her thesis, necessitating an awareness and under-
standing of English rhetoric. In the second interview,
Yuwei expressed concern over critical argumentation in
the following excerpt:
I know that for PhD thesis writing, I need to present critical
arguments, but I have so many questions in mind: will I be in
danger if I sound too outspoken? Or will I sound like a proble-
matic writer that disagrees with the other professors? So I
don’t think I need to refute it. I want to be safe and stable,
you know.
Yuwei appeared to be highly aware of the politics of
writing and the unequal power relations between her
and other authors. This awareness appeared to influ-
ence her writing, prompting her restraint in expressing
personal opinions, specifically those contrary to consen-
sus or those in positions of authority. Yuwei’s attempt
revealed that she believed her writing would be favored
and more acceptable if she intentionally incorporated
the words of authorities in the field. Saying, ‘‘I do not
think I need to refute. I want to be safe and stable’’ also
reflected Yuwei’s conscious decision of not wanting to
exercise critical argumentation skills and her Chinese
discoursal strategy. The preceding excerpt indicated
that Yuwei needed to gain more knowledge about criti-
cal argumentation or was unaware of the significance of
rebuttals in completing argument structure, integrating
argument, and counterargument. The following excerpt
is Yuwei’s reflection on her experience in doctoral thesis
writing:
I find it hard to bring together the different ideas and my own.
I know I need to synthesise, but I had not practised this in
English or Chinese before. So in my thesis, I summarise and
paraphrase to use the information from several sources.
Yuwei’s account indicated that she had minimal expe-
rience and prior knowledge and understanding of the
rhetorical nature of synthesis writing. Moreover, she
highlighted the need to focus on summarizing and para-
phrasing the source text when writing her thesis, which
suggested that she needed to fully understand the vital
role of synthesis and a clear conceptual understanding of
synthesizing from a writing perspective. Briefly, Yuwei
demonstrated underdeveloped writer-source integration
by combining sources and her own ideas. Her lack of
experience with synthesis writing and presenting new
ideas based on interpretations of other evidence or argu-
ments reflected one of the challenges she faced in repre-
senting herself as intertextually knowledgeable
and
adopting an appropriate academic identity (Chang,
2016; Liu & Huang, 2021).
Yuwei’s case highlighted how EFL writers new to crit-
ical argumentation in the target language could find it
unconsciously challenging to change cultural elements
and rhetorical aspects (thinking pattern, audience consid-
eration, and synthesis writing). Chien (2007) argues that
traditional Chinese text structures and rhetorical strate-
gies continue to influence the contemporary English writ-
ing of Chinese students. Yuwei’s experiences reflected the
fact that English rhetoric positioning construction pre-
sents specific challenges for Mainland Chinese students.
In her bachelor’s and master’s degree research projects,
Yuwei was exposed to, directed, and trained in Chinese
rhetoric. This limited her understanding of the target
English language discourse practices.
In this case, audience consideration in the rhetorical
context required considerable readjustments. Specifically,
the readjustments posed challenges to Yuwei as a foreign
language writer due to the differences between English
and Chinese writing. Consequently, this imposed an extra
burden on Yuwei as a writer, influenced her thesis writ-
ing progress, and affected her identity construction as an
academic writer.
Discussion and Conclusion
This study explored the experiences of Chinese EFL doc-
toral students in constructing their academic identities
through critical argumentation in an English-Medium
Instruction (EMI) context. The findings revealed that
critical argumentation plays a crucial role in shaping the
academic identity construction of Chinese EFL students
in their doctoral thesis writing. Using Ivanic’s (1998)
framework of identity building, the doctoral students’
narratives illustrate their struggles in negotiating their
autobiographical, authorial, and discursive selves in aca-
demic writing. Insights into the thesis-writing experiences
of both doctorate students in this study serve to illumi-
nate the various factors underlying their academic iden-
tity construction, particularly in the development of
critical argumentation. These challenges are often rooted
in
linguistic,
cultural,
and
educational
differences
between doctoral students’ life histories and EMI institu-
tional requirements.
This study highlights the influence of the EFL doc-
toral students’ educational background and cultural val-
ues on how they express themselves in their writings. For
instance, Ming acknowledged the importance of critical
thinking in doctoral thesis writing but struggled to
develop her critical voice and defend her authorial posi-
tion. Cultural influences, such as respect for authority,
shaped Ming’s reluctance to critique established authors’
work. Ming’s case highlighted the need for explicit
instruction and support in developing critical argumenta-
tion skills for EFL students.

In another narrative, Yuwei’s difficulties in synthesiz-
ing ideas and rhetorical positioning led to her merely
reiterating facts or summarizing the main ideas. She
relied heavily on referencing famous authors to support
her arguments, reflecting her Chinese expository essay
writing background. This over-reliance on authorities
hindered her ability to construct an authorial voice and
rhetorical positioning in her thesis. Yuwei’s case empha-
sized the challenges of adapting to English academic
writing conventions and the need to understand the
rhetorical differences between Chinese and English.
Studies by Chang (2016; Liu & Huang, 2021) have shown
cultural differences to play a role in shaping Chinese
EFL students’ rhetorical positioning.
Overall, the findings of this study shed light on the com-
plex nature of academic identity construction among the
two Chinese EFL doctoral students in an EMI context.
The participants’ experiences reflected the influence of cul-
tural norms, educational backgrounds, and language profi-
ciency on their engagement with critical argumentation.
The study emphasizes the importance of providing explicit
instruction and support for developing critical argumenta-
tion skills in doctoral programs to facilitate the construc-
tion of academic identities among EFL students. By
addressing these challenges, universities can better prepare
EFL doctoral students for successful academic writing and
contribute to their development as scholars.
The findings open up possibilities for a broader under-
standing of academic writing that values international
graduate students’ educational background and cultural
variety in target English language discourse commu-
nities. In addition, the study’s conclusions could be a
platform for other EMI higher institutions to better pre-
pare for international students’ academic experiences.
International graduate students, for example, can be
offered long-term academic support in coping with their
academic studies.
Limitations of the Study
While the narrative inquiry study on Chinese EFL doc-
toral students’ academic identity construction through
critical argumentation is insightful, there are several lim-
itations to consider, mainly due to the small sample size
of only two female Chinese respondents. First, the
study’s findings may not represent all Chinese EFL doc-
toral students as the sample size is small and homoge-
neous.
Therefore,
the
study’s
results
should
be
generalized with caution. Second, the study’s focus on
only two female Chinese respondents limits the scope of
the study in terms of gender and cultural diversity.
Gender and cultural differences may impact the way
individuals construct their academic identities, and by
only focusing on two female participants, the study may
not account for these differences. Lastly, the study’s
focus on only academic identity construction through
critical
argumentation
may
not
be
comprehensive
enough to capture the full scope of factors that influence
academic identity construction. Other factors, such as
educational background, cultural values, and institu-
tional context, may also shape academic identities. In
conclusion, while the narrative inquiry study on Chinese
EFL doctoral students’ academic identity construction
through critical argumentation is insightful, its limita-
tions should be considered when interpreting the results.
Future research should address these limitations by using
larger and more diverse samples, incorporating multiple
perspectives, and considering a broader range of factors
that impact academic identity construction.
Furthermore, it would be valuable to explore the
experiences of other international doctoral students in
other contexts and disciplines to understand further
the challenges they face in developing their critical
voice and authorial position in their thesis writing.
Finally, longitudinal studies that track EFL doctoral
students’ development over time would be valuable for
understanding the long-term effects of interventions
and support strategies on their academic writing skills
and identity construction.
