The present study analyses the lexical bundles (LBs) used by 
scholars of PhD linguistics in Pakistani universities. For this 
purpose, a small corpus of the abstracts of 73 PhD linguistics 
theses ranging from 2017 to 2022 was built. Antconc software 
was used to get the frequencies of the LBs. The objectives of the 
study were to examine the structural and functional taxonomies 
of those LBs. Biber’s (1999) classification was used for the 
structural analysis, while Hyland’s (2008) classification was used 
for the functional analysis. The study found there is a less 
tendency toward the use of 4-word LBs. It was disappointing to 
observe a low frequency of structural analysis for 4-word LBs. On 
the other hand, the functional classification of the LBs was 
relatively satisfactory due to the discovery of a higher number of 
4-word LBs.The study stresses the importance of teaching the 
structure and functions of LBs from the intermediate level so that 
when these students reach the postgraduate level, they should be 
able to adhere to the rules of cohesion and coherence.

Introduction 
Academic writing requires a specific language that has its own vocabulary, norms, set of 
conventions, and modes of inquiry (Al-Zamel, 1998). Academic writing is planned, focused, 
structured, evidenced, and formal in tone and style. Language for academic purposes is different 
from how spoken language is constructed. Academic language is learned and developed. New 
writers, especially non-native writers, require targeted instructions. In the Pakistani context, 
where English has enjoyed the official language status for decades, students still face difficulties 
in mastering academic writing. These problems include lacking analytical skills, relying solely on 
grammatical rules, and inadequate knowledge of native-like language expression. 
 
The lexical bundles are an excellent way of enhancing the academic writing skills of 
students (Biber, Conrad, & Cortes, 2003). The structures and functions of Lexical Bundles are 
not taught in Pakistani academia, making it challenging for even postgraduate students to write 
effectively. Lexical bundles are multi-word strings also called ‘Ingrams’ or ‘lexical chunks’, such 
as, to the point, in the end, on the other hand, and at the end of. Lexical bundles were identified 
by Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, and Finegan (1999) as “bundles of words that show a 
statistical tendency to co-occur”. There can be three words, four words, or five words LBs. 
Usually, three words LBs are common, five words LBs are rare, and four words LBs stand in 
between these two. Using lexical bundles is a perfect parameter for judging a writer’s quality of 
academic writing. 
 
Moreover, instead of writing fragmented sentences, LBs are an easy and smooth way to 
carry on the flow of the message. The significance of lexical bundles can be found in their 
contribution to fluent and natural language production. They function as ready-made chunks of 
language on which speakers can rely to convey their intended meaning efficiently. Lexical bundles

improve communication fluency and accuracy by acting as a link between individual words and 
more complex sentence structures. They are also important in academic writing and discourse 
because they aid in transmitting specialized knowledge and disciplinary conventions. 
 
Researchers gain insights into the patterns and structures of language use by studying 
lexical bundles, allowing them to understand better how words and phrases are combined in 
different contexts. Lexical bundle analysis can reveal necessary information about language 
acquisition, language processing, and the characteristics of specific communication genres or 
registers. Overall, lexical bundle research benefits linguistics research because it sheds light on 
the underlying mechanisms of language production and has practical implications for language 
teaching and learning.  
 
Corpus linguistics is the most reliable and effective method to extract LBs from the 
collection of selected data. Corpus linguistics’ practicality and reliability make analysing even a 
huge amount of data easy. Corpus linguistics is a great help for language teachers as it highlights 
patterns of correct language use. For example, ‘concordance’ makes examining any word or 
phrase in a context very easy. This facility of corpus analysis identifies the company of the words 
they keep. In other words, the corpus helps determine the collocation of the words. Moreover, 
in terms of LBs, Corpus also highlights the structure and functions of frequent LBs. 
 
Students in Pakistan who are pursuing graduate and postgraduate degrees are required 
to produce academic papers and theses, the majority of which must be written in the English 
language. Because of this, it is essential for students to acquire a strong command of the English 
language in order to get better results in their academic writing tasks and to participate in 
research initiatives. On the other hand, acquiring research literacy and writing for academic 
reasons might be difficult for pupils in Pakistan due to a number of obstacles. According to Ilyas 
and Khan (2015), students' lack of analytical abilities and weak command of the English language 
are two of the most fundamental challenges they confront. The majority of postgraduate students 
include a discussion of it in their drafts of their theses and dissertations. The current investigation 
is centered on the problem of inadequate command of the English language. The researcher will 
extract the usage of lexical bundles in doctoral theses in the field of linguistics in order to provide 
new writers with assistance in enhancing their grammatical abilities. 
 
The investigation of lexical bundles in Ph.D. Linguistics Dissertation Abstracts from 
universities in Pakistan carry substantial importance. Through the examination of the occurrence, 
structure, and purpose of these lexical bundles, valuable insights are gained into the language 
usage patterns of scholars within this discipline. Emphasizing the early instruction of lexical 
bundle structure and function becomes crucial, as it equips students with the necessary skills to 
enhance coherence and cohesion in their academic writing as they advance through higher 
educational levels. This study's findings highlight the significance of such instruction in promoting 
effective written communication within the field of linguistics. The Research Objectives are to 
analyze the Lexical bundles’ structural and functional taxonomies in the dissertations’ abstracts 
and to examine the structural relationships between lexical bundles. 
 
2.  
Literature Review 
This chapter reviews the previous research on LBs regarding academic discourse. This 
review will help us determine the theoretical grounding for the current research. Previously 
conducted researches suggest the pedagogical value of the LBs. The significance of using LBs 
cannot be ignored from the academic writing perspective. The more research is conducted on 
academic data, the clearer picture of academic writing can be viewed. O’Flynn (2022) conducted 
an important study in the subject of lexical bundles, and he came to the conclusion that 
instructors who want to include disciplinary lexical bundles into their instruction at different levels 
are now encountering a great deal of difficulty in doing so. In order to accomplish this, he offers 
a selection of resources in the form of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) software to 
those individuals who are instructing academic writing in fields related to the arts and humanities. 
 
In their research, Kim and Kessler (2022) have Trgeted the writings of L2 English learners 
to examine the occurrences of recurring formulaic sequences. The findings show that students 
who scored high and low had different numbers of 3-word combinations. They also used different 
word combinations, which could explain their scores. The authors suggest that teachers should 
notice these patterns in second-language writing classes. They also recommend more research

on how the specific language used by second language learners affects their scores. Zhang, Yu, 
and Zhang (2021) did a comparative study of a self-built corpus of expert writers and EFL 
students. They found a significant difference between these two types of writing. The students’ 
corpora showed more usage of verb phrase-based bundles, and there was less frequent use of 
prepositional phrase-based and noun phrase-based lexical bundles. However, when it comes to 
the functional categories, the study showed somewhat similar results of the two groups. He used 
Biber et al. (1999) structural taxonomy and functional taxonomy for this study. 
 
Cui and Kim (2021) explored the use of bundles in the field of English education. He 
examined, in particular, the development between 2001 and 2020. He compiled a massive bundle 
of 2390093 words where he found that there is a huge number of changes in the usage of these 
bundles throughout these 20 years. Khamkhien (2021) in his analysis of Thai L2 English learner’s 
academic writing, found a difference in the use of native and non-native writers when it comes 
to lexical bundles. This study was done on 53 research reports containing 60 thousand-plus 
words. Ren (2021), on the other hand, compares the variability and functions in the applied 
linguistics and pharmaceutical sciences’ research articles. They applied Biber et al. (2003) and 
Biber et al. (2004) as the framework of their study. Their study sheds light on the importance of 
teaching lexical bundle patterns to improve the academic writing of students. 
 
Using Biber's functional taxonomies of lexical bundles, Hussain, Zahra, and Abbas (2021) 
investigated the discourse functions of lexical bundles in Pakistani chemistry and physics 
textbooks. As stance expressions, discourse organizers, and referential expressions, lexical 
bundles are common in university classroom teaching, according to Biber and Barbieri (2007). 
Lexical bundles are also common in academic writing. This particular study has been built on 
prior research by analysing the utilization of LBs across various spoken and written registers 
based on university registers, including instructional as well as student advising contexts. 
Surprisingly, non-academic registers have a higher frequency of lexical bundles, especially in 
written course management, contradicting previous findings favoring speech over writing. 
 
The most relevant study to the current research is done by Yousaf (2019), who explored 
the use of LBs as building blocks of academic discourse. According to him, all dissertations from 
multiple disciplines show a heavy reliance on the use of LBs. However, the structure and function 
of these LBs vary from discipline to discipline, which is quite interesting to know. Take for 
instance, the field of English studies, which has the highest percentage of noun phrase fragments, 
whereas the field of biosciences has the highest percentage of verb phrase fragments. Let's look 
at this in more detail. For the purpose of conducting a structural analysis of discipline-specific 
LBs, Noor and Anwar (2019) utilized the taxonomy developed by Biber et al. (1999). The results 
are pretty much the same as the previous studies. The results of such studies put stress on the 
importance of a language pedagogy in academia that is frequency based. 
 
Professionals in applied linguistics and literature have been observed to employ bundles 
with varying frequencies, exhibit distinct preferences when selecting lexical items to complete 
structural bundles, and employ functional bundles in diverse manners. Rezaie, Farahani, and 
Masoomzadeh (2020) have compared the use of lexical bundles in Ph.D. dissertations and Master 
theses. These researchers have observed that the abstract part of PhD and M.A dissertations has 
more lexical bundles than other most important genres of theses, i.e., introduction and 
conclusion. 
 
In addition, Shin, Cortes, and Yoo (2018) conducted an exploratory study in which they 
looked into the use of definite articles inside lexical bundles in the academic writing of L2 
students. They discovered that writers of a second language utilize a smaller number of lexical 
bundles that are less diverse. The research also showed that students commonly make errors 
while utilizing definite articles within these bundles, mainly by omitting them. This was the most 
common type of error. According to the findings, lexical bundles might be an effective educational 
tool for teaching the usage of definite articles in writing in a second language. Hyland, in his 
article titled "Lexical bundles and disciplinary variation," published in 2008, explores the function 
of four-word bundles in the academic language of several fields. In this study, a corpus of 
research articles, doctorate dissertations, and Master's theses are analyzed to determine the 
frequency of bundles as well as preferences for their use. The findings emphasize the importance 
of bundles in shaping disciplinary variation and establishing textual coherence.

This literature review covers the updated work on lexical bundles in the past 5 years. It 
covers different aspects of lexical bundles being explored by different researchers, including their 
pedagogical value in academic writing, challenges faced by teachers, the occurrence of formulaic 
sequences in L2 English learners' writing, differences in bundle usage between expert writers and 
EFL students, changes in bundle usage over time, variation across disciplines, and discourse 
functions in specific subjects. It emphasizes the significance of lexical bundles in academic writing 
and the need to teach bundle patterns for improved writing skills. However, no significant study 
fills the gap of careful examination of the Ph.D. linguistics’ dissertations written by Pakistani 
scholars. Therefore this study is aimed at filling this gap.  
 
3. 
Methodology 
3.1 
Population and Delimitation of the Study  
The population of this study is PhD linguistics theses archived in the HEC repository. It 
has been found that the ‘abstract’ of such theses contain more bundles than the other two-part 
genres, i.e., Introduction and Conclusion Rezaie et al. (2020). Hence, to delimit the study, the 
abstracts of theses published during 2017-2022 were considered for the corpus analyses. These 
abstracts are 73 in number.  
 
3.2 
Instrumentation 
Lawrence Anthony’s “Antconc 3.5” software has been used to extract the lexical bundles 
from the selected files. The cluster’s minimum size of lexical bundles was set to 4, and the 
maximum size was also set to 4. The minimum frequency and range were selected as 5.  
 
3.3 
Research Questions 
i. 
What are the structural and functional characteristics of the lexical bundles in PhD 
linguistics theses? 
ii. 
How do lexical bundles in PhD linguistics theses exhibit structural relationships? 
 
4.  
The Framework 
The article "Structural Classification of Lexical Bundles in Academic Prose" which was 
published in 1999 by Biber et al. serves as the foundation for the conceptual framework that 
underpins the structural analysis of lexical bundles. The key work "Structural Classification of 
Lexical Bundles in Academic Prose" by Biber et al., which was published in 1999, has made a 
substantial contribution to our understanding of syntactic as well as discourse-level patterns in 
academic writing. This groundbreaking study sought to identify and categorize lexical bundles, 
or recurring word combinations, in a corpus of academic prose. Biber et al. used a comprehensive 
methodology to analyze a large corpus of diverse disciplines, allowing them to capture typical 
phraseological patterns in academic writing. Their findings shed light on the structural 
organization of lexical bundles, their distribution across disciplines, and their role in 
communicating specific communicative functions. The study by Biber et al. remains a cornerstone 
in the field, guiding subsequent research on phraseology in academic discourse. Hence, Biber et 
al.’s 1999 work, “Structural Classification of Lexical Bundles in Academic Prose,” is a seminal 
theoretical framework for analyzing and classifying lexical bundles in academic writing. 
 
When analyzing the functional classification of lexical bundles, the functional framework 
proposed by Hyland (2008) is preferred over that of Biber et al. (1999). As Hyland himself states, 
Biber's framework is more useful for larger spoken and written corpora rather than smaller genre-
based analysis of written texts. Hyland (2008) functional framework has been influential in 
academic writing research. This framework presents a systematic approach to understanding the 
communicative functions of linguistic features in academic discourse. By exploring the rhetorical 
purposes and pragmatic functions of language choices, Hyland’s framework provides valuable 
insights into how writers employ language to construct meaning and convey disciplinary 
knowledge. This influential work has shaped subsequent research on academic writing, 
facilitating a deeper understanding of the interplay between language use, discourse conventions, 
and disciplinary practices in academic contexts. Before the study’s analysis, here is a quick primer 
on both frameworks. The Biber’s framework for the structural analysis of Lexical Bundles is 
presented in table 1.

Results And Discussions 
The suggested setting in the software showed 13 types of LBs. The following are the most 
common LBs in the 73 abstracts chosen for the study.  
 
5.1 
Frequency of LBs 
The most frequent 4-word LB is ‘In the field of’, which is only ten times frequent and is 
found in only 08 abstracts. Lexical cohesion refers to the unity of text achieved by the author’s 
usage of words with an interconnected lexical or semantic string of words (Nunan, 1993). Overall, 
only thirteen 4-word LBs are found among all 73 abstracts, which shows a lack of cohesive style 
in the abstracts. In order to achieve cohesion, one must adopt more and more LBs.

The most frequent 4-words LB is ‘In the field of’, which is only ten times frequent and is 
found in only 08 abstracts. Lexical cohesion refers to the unity of text achieved by the author's 
usage of words with an interconnected lexical or semantic string of words (Nunan, 1993). Overall, 
only thirteen 4-word LBs are found among all 73 abstracts, which shows a lack of cohesive style 
in the abstracts. In order to achieve cohesion, one must adopt more and more LBs.  
 
5.2 
Structural Classification of LBs 
According to Biber’s model, the structural analysis shows that for the last five years, Ph.D. 
scholars have used a much smaller number of common lexical strings of words. As mentioned, 
very few structures have a frequency of more than five.  
 
Table 4: Structural Classification of Lexical Bundles in Academic Prose in the Abstracts 
of the Ph.D. Linguistics dissertations (Biber et al., 1999) 
 
 
The table presents a comprehensive analysis of the lexical cohesion within the abstracts 
of Ph.D. dissertations in the field of linguistics. The study focuses on identifying and classifying 
4-word lexical bundles (LBs) present in the abstracts. Surprisingly, the research reveals a scarcity 
of such bundles, with only a few examples found throughout the selected dissertation abstracts. 
Moreover, most structural strings exhibit a complete absence of any LBs. This indicates a 
significant lack of cohesive writing style among the academic prose in these abstracts,

emphasizing the need for greater utilization of lexical bundles to enhance textual coherence and 
readability. 
 
Table 5: Structural Relationships between Lexical Bundles Instances 
 
 
Another way to analyze the lexical bundles used by scholars was to see what type of 
lexical relationship is present in the lexical bundles. We can see a relatively satisfactory pack of 
examples here though the frequency element has not been included in this type of analysis. 
Although the number of lexical bundles is relatively higher compared to previous findings, it 
remains insufficient to establish strong structural relationships between instances. Enhancing the 
utilization of lexical bundles is essential to improve overall textual cohesion and coherence. 
 
5.3 
Functional Classification of LBs  
The researcher preferred Hyland’s functional framework for the functional classification of 
the LBs used in the PhD Dissertations by Pakistani scholars; There is a hint of relatively frequent 
use of research, text, and participant-oriented LBs.

Table 6 provides an overview of the different types of lexical bundles found in the abstracts 
of the selected dissertations. Interestingly, with the exception of "procedure," instances for each 
type of bundle have been identified. Although the total number of 4 words lexical strings is only 
seven, this demonstrates a relative emphasis on research-oriented language patterns, reflecting 
the authors' commitment to presenting their findings cohesively and effectively. Nevertheless, it 
hints at the authors' proficiency in crafting academic prose focusing on clarity and precision. 
 
Table 7: Text-oriented Bundles Instances in the Selected Dissertation’s Abstracts 
 
 
Table 7 displays instances of types of bundles found within the abstracts of the selected 
dissertations. The presence of instances for every type of bundle is a positive sign, indicating a 
well-developed and cohesive writing style. It demonstrates that the authors have effectively 
employed lexical bundles to connect ideas and enhance the overall coherence of their texts.  
 
The table 8 titled "Participant-oriented Bundles Instances in the Selected Dissertation’s 
Abstracts" presents instances of two types of bundles, namely "Stance features" and 
"Engagement features," found in the abstracts of the Ph.D. dissertations. Only one example of 
"stance features" was discovered, while no instances of "Engagement features" were found. This

indicates a limited utilization of participant-oriented bundles, which may affect the overall 
coherence and depth of the research abstracts.

Conclusion  
The study was conducted on using LBs in the PhD linguistics dissertations by Pakistani 
scholars. The researcher used a mixed framework. Among all the parts of any dissertation, the 
abstract is said to include a more significant number of LBs because it presents all necessary 
information in a few words. For such a purpose, a researcher must use fixed expressions that 
may contain a more significant message. Therefore, the study’s focus was on the dissertation’s 
abstract. Overall, the most frequent 4-word LBs were considerably fewer in number. Even the 
most frequent among all the 73 abstracts happened to appear only ten times. The study showed 
that according to the structural classification of Biber, only a few 4-words LBs came into focus. 
However, when it came to the classification according to the functions of LBs the analysis showed 
that the PhD scholars had used them relatively frequently.  
 
Grammar, writing skills, and structure analysis are usually taught at the intermediate 
level. They carry these skills at the postgraduate level: It is high time the students at the 
intermediate level should be taught how to improve their academic writing skills. Teachers should 
teach the structures and functions of the LBs so that the students must be aware of these chunks. 
Knowledge of the structure, function, and usage of LBs will help students improve their cohesion 
and coherence in their academic writing. Secondly, students should be taught the most frequent 
LBs in the very beginning. In the later stage, they can also be made acquainted with less common 
or rare types of LBs. This will help them master the usage of the most commonly used LBs.  
 
The current research has been conducted on a smaller scale. There is a vast scope for 
analyzing LBs in larger corpora. The study can be conducted for all the PhD linguistics 
dissertations. A larger corpus should result in much better analysis and findings. Moreover, a 
diachronic study will also be very interesting.
