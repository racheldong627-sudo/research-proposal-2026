ABSTRACT 
 
Research on EFL doctoral thesis writing is booming. The literature indicates a link between 
doctoral thesis writing and identity formation. Despite the call for scholarly attention on 
doctoral thesis writers, writers of doctoral theses in English as a Foreign language (EFL) 
settings have not been well represented in the previous studies. Moreover, although writer 
identity has been proposed as consisting of four aspects, most of the research has mainly 
adopted a corpus approach to discuss the discoursal self or authorial identity. To bridge these 
gaps, this study explored how multicultural writers at a university in Thailand constructed 
identity through EFL doctoral thesis writing and how their multiple aspects of writer identity 
interplayed. With the data triangulated from a questionnaire, written narratives, and semi-
structured interviews, the study revealed that 1) multiple identities are developed through 
writers’ self-adjustment and social acculturation; 2) passive alignment to institutional 
conventions leads to an actual distancing from discoursal construction of writer identity; 3) 
self-marginalization as EFL learners, negative external voices, and the role of student writer 
most hinder the development and representation of the authorial self. The research recommends 
EFL learners should be explicitly informed of the notions of constructing an authorial voice in 
the writing of doctoral theses.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Identity is not an optional but an integral part of the act of writing (Burgess & Ivanič, 2010; 
Ivanič & Camps, 2001; Matsuda, 2015); writing indicates every single feature of the writer’s 
complex identity (Ivanič, 1998). In recent decades, literature on EFL Writing  has highlighted 
the significance of identity construction in academic writing development (Hyland, 2015; 
Hyland & Tse, 2012; Ivanič, 1998; Lillis, 1997; Matsuda, 2015; Matsuda & Tardy, 2007; Mora, 
2017; Xu & Zhang, 2019). In academic discourse, individuals learn to participate in the 
academic community, and a key part of this socialization process is to perform one’s identity 
as a writer (Olmos Lopez, 2015). Researchers have proposed that writer identity is a valuable 
tool in contributing to the quality of writing for writers from different cultures (Javdan, 2014; 
Matsuda, 2001; Mora, 2017), and thus should be an essential component of L2 writing 
pedagogy (Olmos Lopez, 2015). 
Previous research has conceptualized writer identity within the socially available 
resources of self-expression. Lexical, syntactic, semantic, visual, and material resources are

utilized to construct writer identity (Ivanič, 1998; Starfield, 2007). Certain linguistic features 
are proposed as signals of authorial presence, reflecting writers’ discoursal construction of 
authoritativeness. Self-mention is also found to play an essential role in writer identity 
development (Kuo, 1999; Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999). Some scholars suggest that novice 
writers should use first-person pronouns and the active voice to display academic writer 
identity clearly and powerfully, and thus gain readers’ acceptance of their ideas. The use of the 
third person and the passive voice potentially reduces the writer’s agency, leading to an unequal 
power relationship between the writers and their readers (Fairclough, 2003). Furthermore, other 
resources, such as evaluating the existing literature (John, 2012) and strongly asserting or 
arguing (Roux, Mora, & Trejo, 2011; Zhang & Pramoolsook), can also display authorial 
identity in written texts. 
Social aspects are taken into consideration when exploring identity in written texts. 
The writers’ backgrounds, especially concerning English language proficiency, home cultural 
backgrounds, and exposure to the notions of authorial identity, impact on EFL writer identity 
construction. For example, low English language proficiency hinders Chinese students’ 
confidence in self-identifying as writers (Yang, 2006). Scholarly attention on the culturally 
loaded influence from writers’ mother tongues shows that Asian students have difficulties in 
reasoning in their encounter with Western epidemiological assumptions (Ramanathan & 
Atkinson, 1999). Influenced by their first-language literacy experience, EFL students are not 
confident to claim authoritativeness (Hyland, 2002). To adjust oneself to create a new identity 
in the text(s), EFL writers develop strategies such as avoidance, accommodation, 
opposition/resistance, transposition, and appropriation (Canagarajah, 2003). 
The literature review indicates a link between doctoral thesis writing and identity 
formation. Doctoral learning attaches the same importance to knowledge construction and 
identity formation (Green, 2005). Writing a doctoral thesis brings in major identity 
transformation (Xu & Hu, 2019) and a shift from student writers to scholarly writers (Morton 
& Storch, 2019). Doctoral thesis writers encounter challenges in finding and presenting their 
voices (Starfield & Paltridge, 2019). Writers in EFL settings have been under-represented in 
the literature (Belcher, 2013). Initial studies of learner identity, conducted in countries where 
English represents the dominant means of communication, focused predominantly on 
immigrant learners’ experiences of studying a second language (L2) in their host countries or 
other similar locations (e.g., Belz, 2002; Kanno, 2003; Norton, 2000; Norton & Toohey, 2001; 
Pavlenko, 2001). Despite the call for scholarly attention on doctoral thesis writers (Paré, 2019), 
there is little research into EFL doctoral thesis writers’ development in Non-Native English-
speaking countries, such as Thailand. 
Furthermore, although writer identity has been proposed to consist of four aspects—
autobiographical self, discoursal self, authorial self, and possibilities of selfhood (Ivanič, 1998), 
most of the research has mainly adopted a corpus approach to discuss the discoursal self (Ivanič, 
1998; Rahimivand & Kuhi, 2014) or authorial identity (Hyland, 2015). As this research gap 
reveals, there is an urgent need to critically address how the multiple aspects of writer identity 
are developed and interact with each other. With respect to these concerns, we attempt to 
establish the voices of writers and explore how writers’ multiple identities are shaped and 
developed through the practice of EFL doctoral thesis writing. 
 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
 
ORIENTATIONS OF RESEARCH ON WRITER IDENTITY 
 
Within a set of shared views about identity, the tension between individual and social 
perspectives has been increasingly recognized. An individualistic orientation to writer identity

aims to liberate the writer from traditional social bonds and to enhance self-exploration 
(Bowden, 1999). This extreme view advocates authentic individual expression and believes in 
the existence of a coherent and autonomous identity. It has caused some writers to resist social 
conventions (Benwell & Stokoe, 2006; Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999). On the contrary, a 
social-constructionist orientation regards identity as a social construct generated and 
maintained by communities (Benwell & Stokoe, 2006; Bruffee, 1986; Ivanič, 1998). This 
means that any kind of identity involves affiliating individuals to shared beliefs and values 
which are available in the social context. This view derives from studies committed to 
identifying discourse patterns (e.g., Li & Deng, 2019) and providing guidelines to novice 
writers. Some researchers have criticized this orientation as uncritically treating identity as a 
fixed and stable entity (Parker, 1989), which overlooks individual variations (Matsuda, 2015).  
Spacing between the two extreme positions is the social constructivist orientation, 
which accounts for how individual uniqueness and social conventions can coexist and are 
mutually interdependent. With a social constructivist view, Ivanič (1998), Prior (2001), 
Matsuda (2015), and McKinley (2017) propose writing as an act of writing, socially 
constructed rather than socially determined. Individual writers who struggle for alternative 
ways to enter a privileged social group may potentially cause change (Ivanič, 1998). Claiming 
identity is not “reducible to genres” (Prior, 2001, p. 61), social constructivists propose that 
sense of self is constructed in the interplay between the individual and social networks. 
Researchers should consider how the conventions or norms have become established and 
stabilized by individuals, and how individuals adjust their writings to “the particular rhetorical 
situation” (Matsuda, 2015, p.149). The social constructivist perspective seeks to identify the 
interaction between the reader and the writer that is mediated through texts. This study accepts 
the social constructivist orientation and examines how EFL doctoral thesis writers develop their 
authorial identities and adjust their writings to a strictly disciplined academia. From this point 
of view, EFL doctoral thesis writing is a social practice situated in both disciplinary and 
institutionalized local settings.  
 
CONCEPTUALIZATION OF WRITER IDENTITY 
 
Identity in writing has been addressed by using different terms, such as subjectivity (Weedon, 
1997), self (Goffman, 1981), positioning (Davies & Harré, 1990), voice (Matsuda, 2001; 2015), 
and identity (Ivanič, 1998). Although these terms have differently nuanced connotations 
(Rahimivand & Kuhi, 2014), they can be used interchangeably with different emphases (Ivanič, 
1998): self is more concerned with private aspects, subjectivity and positioning are more 
focused on socially constrained roles.  
Identity construction is generally accepted as multiple, dynamic, inherently social 
rather than individual, and develops a sense of who one is and who one might be through 
socially shared meaning-making (Ivanič, 1998; Matsuda, 2001, 2015). Identity is a social 
endeavor instead of an isolated achievement (Hyland, 2010; Prior, 2001). A writer acquires 
disciplinary knowledge and negotiates himself with the dominant literacy in the community 
(Guinda & Hyland, 2012). However, he is not free to simply choose from infinite rhetorical 
and linguistic resources, but is obliged to take on a “suitable” identity in the associated 
community (Ivanič & Camps, 2001). Through the use of community discourses, one claims or 
resists membership of social groups to define who he is. Matsuda (2001) defines identity (or 
voice in his preference) as “the amalgamative effect of the use of discursive and non-discursive 
features that language users choose, deliberately or otherwise, from a socially available yet 
ever-changing repertoire” (p. 40).  
We examine all these perspectives and define writer identity as a self-presentation 
that aligns the individual thesis writer with and differentiates himself from others in the shared

discourse community. Doctoral writers constitute a sense of being through negotiating with the 
socially shared and enabled resources. The interpersonal meaning-making process of thesis 
writing provides the site where identity is constituted and reconstituted.  
To examine the multiple layers of identities of writers, we adopt Ivanič’s conceptual 
framework (1998), “four aspects of identity.” Autobiographical self is the established identity 
that a writer brings to the act of writing. It is formed by ones’ “prior social and discoursal 
history” and constitutes his “current way of being” (Ivanič, 1998, p. 24). Along with developing 
the lived experience, a writer’s autobiographical self is “socially constructed and constantly 
changing” (p.24) and thus affects how he writes. This layer of identity is constructed in social 
contexts, but remains individual in the sense that it is unique due to the richness and complexity 
of frequently changing life experiences. 
The Discoursal self is the impression the writer makes on the reader which is 
“constructed through the discourse characteristics of a text” (Ivanič, 1998, p. 25). It is related 
to values, beliefs, and power relations in the particular social context in which the text is written. 
The Discoursal self is closely tied to a text. It is about how the writer would like to appear in 
his text by using discursive and non-discursive features. The writer’s anticipation of how 
readers will reach to a text influences how he represents self .  
The authorial self concerns the sense of self as an author and the presence of this 
sense in a written text. A writer perceives himself as an author to a greater or lesser extent and 
develops this sense of authoritativeness in writing. Thus, writers distinguish from each other 
regarding “how far they claim authority as the source of the content of the text, and how far 
they establish an authorial presence in their writing” (Ivanič, 1998, p.26). In this study, we 
investigate how authoritative EFL doctoral theses writers feel, how they establish their 
authorship for the content, and the extent to which they attribute the authorship to themselves. 
The three aspects of writer identity mentioned above concern “actual people writing 
actual texts” (Ivanič, 1998, p.26). They are identity portraits connected with different 
individuals. However, the last aspect, possibilities for selfhood, does not belong to any 
individual. This refers to the social resources that allow or constrain people to construct a sense 
of themselves as being appropriate for the situation. The disciplinary conventions and 
institutional requirements represent the privileged patterns of writing an EFL doctoral thesis in 
a specific educational context.  
There is a two-way relationship between the socially enabled possibilities for 
selfhood and the individual’s actual identity in the actual writing. On the one hand, the social, 
cultural, and institutional possibilities for selfhood constrain the shape of the three aspects of 
actual writers. According to his social group membership, a writer develops an 
autobiographical self and constructs a discoursal self out of a specific socio-cultural and 
institutional context. On the other hand, attempts at constructing a discoursal self from less 
privileged possibilities for selfhood may contribute to a change in the future possibilities for 
selfhood.  
With this conceptual framework, we shall answer the two research questions: 
 
1) How is writer identity constructed in EFL doctoral thesis writing? 
2) In what ways do the multiple aspects of a writer’s identity interplay through EFL 
doctoral thesis writing? 
 
METHOD 
 
We adopted a mixed-method design to understand better the complex, multifaceted, dynamic 
identity of EFL doctoral thesis writers. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected

and analyzed. The two sets of analyses were integrated to cross-validate and compare the 
findings (Creswell, 2015; Leavy, 2017).  
 
RESEARCH SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS 
 
This research is a part of an extensive study that examined EFL postgraduate thesis writing in 
a university in northeastern Thailand. Statistics show that 146 students from 25 countries are 
currently studying at the university for their graduate degrees. The university provides twenty 
doctoral-level programs in the English language, aiming at producing competent academics 
and professionals, especially in conducting research independently for knowledge construction 
and continued academic advancement (Regulations for Graduate Studies, 2017). Doctoral 
students who pass a qualifying examination are eligible to carry out independent scholarly 
research for a doctoral thesis. The language used in writing a thesis may be Thai or a foreign 
language, but in practice, it is usually English. The thesis is approved and examined by a thesis 
committee that consists of no less than five program instructors and external examiners. 
Doctoral students are required to publish (parts of) their thesis work in a national or 
international journal.   
Thirty-one doctoral thesis writers voluntarily participated in the online EFL 
postgraduate thesis writer identity survey. The respondents were from seven Asian countries: 
China (n=15), Indonesia (n=6), Vietnam (n=4), Thailand (n=2), Laos (n=1), Myanmar (n=2), 
and Pakistan (n=1). Of these, out of practical concerns, eleven volunteers (see Table 1) were 
purposefully selected for the narrative inquiry session.

DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES 
 
The data was collected through three research instruments, generally in a sequential method. 
We first administered the EFL Postgraduate Thesis Writer Identity Survey that we had 
previously developed and piloted. Adapted from Ruggles (2012), this five-point Likert-scale 
survey (see Appendix) integrated four aspects of writer identity (Ivanič, 1998) and identity 
formation (Hawkins, 2005). A total of 40 questions were arranged in the following five 
constructs: autobiographical self, discoursal self, authorial self, possibilities of selfhood, and 
writer identity development. Thirty-one questionnaires were returned with all items completed. 
To give voice to the thesis writers, we conducted the following narrative inquiry with 
eleven selected participants. A narrative inquiry, through both written responses and 
interviews, has been previously employed to research identity issues (Fang, 2018). In order to 
obtain a clear informed consensus, the participants were asked to respond to prompts about the 
development of academic writing ability, experience of EFL doctoral thesis writing, and 
change of sense of self. Next, we interviewed the same participants to obtain oral data about

their EFL doctoral thesis writing experiences. An interview is useful for collecting information 
about people’s experiences and opinions (Holstein & Gubrium, 2004). The interview questions 
were separated into two categories. The first was fifteen semi-structured and open-ended 
questions, concerning the experiences of thesis writing, the transformations into thesis writers, 
negotiating a sense of self, authorship, and power relations. The second was asked in a talk-
around-text manner. These questions emerged from our analysis of the data obtained from the 
previous data collection procedures.  
Since we developed all the research instruments by referring to previous studies, the 
instruments’ validity and reliability should be checked carefully. Item-objective Congruence 
(IOC), developed by Rovinelli and Hambleton (1977), was adopted to examine the content 
validity of the instruments. We sent the evaluation forms to three experts in the filed and invited 
them to check whether the research instruments measure what they are designed to do. Each 
expert rated the items and/or questions independently by giving scores from +1 to -1. A rating 
of 1 means the item is congruent with the objective; -1 means the item is not congruent with 
the objective; and 0 means the congruence of the item is unclear. Then IOC analysis of each 
instrument was conducted by examining the experts’ opinions. The results of the IOC analysis 
for the survey was 87.2%, for the written narrative 100%, and for the interview 86.7%. This 
indicated a high content validity regarding the minimum acceptable value which should be 
higher or equal to 0.5 (≥0.5) (Rovinelli & Hambleton, 1977). All the statistics showed that the 
instruments were highly valid in terms of the content. Cronbach’s Alpha (α) Coefficient is 
capable of indicating the extent to which particular items in a survey measure a specified 
construct (Christmann & Van Aelst, 2006). We ran Cronbach’s Alpha (α) analysis and obtained 
the result of 0.882, which is higher than the minimum acceptable value 0.70 (α ≥ 0.70) (George 
& Mallery 2003). Thus, we established the internal consistency of the items. 
 
DATA ANALYSIS 
 
The data analysis was based on the following: First, the data generated from the survey was 
analyzed using descriptive and frequency statistics, to examine the general tendencies in the 
data and the spread of the scores. Second, the data drawn from the written narratives and audio-
taped interviews were analysed thematically (Saldaña, 2009). Member check was adopted over 
the process of interview data analysis. Then the written narratives and interview transcripts 
were analyzed both “vertically and horizontally” (Prabjandee, 2020, p. 8). In the vertical 
analysis, the data from each instrument were analyzed following the stages of open coding, 
categorizing units of meaning, and developing themes. Then the data were horizontally 
analyzed across instruments to refine the themes and interpret the relationships between them. 
During this process, we iteratively alternated between reading the texts, listening to the 
interview recordings, and referring to the literature’s established themes.   
 
RESULTS 
 
The data from both the surveys and the narrative inquiries revealed a remarkable result. All the 
aspects of writer identity were dynamically shaped and developed through linguistic and non-
linguistic features. In interacting with the social context and negotiating within themselves, the 
EFL doctoral thesis writers developed a particular self in the complex interplay of other 
identities. It should be noted that all the quotes from the narrative inquiries are original. We 
extract particular cases to present the themes instead of telling every thesis writer’s stories.

AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELF 
 
We report the findings related to autobiographical self in term of the participants’1) academic 
writing literary practices, 2) conceptualization of thesis writing, and 3) a sense of self-worth. 
Overall, the participants had developed the ability to write in English for academic 
purposes, more or less, earlier in their studies. Long-term learning and using English “helped 
lay the very foundation of writing properly” in the discourse (Amy, Interview). Most of the 
participants started their EFL academic writing in their undergraduate education. The most 
frequently mentioned academic writing tasks were articles, theses, course papers, exams, and 
research reports. Descriptive analysis (see Table 2) indicated a positive impact of these 
experiences on the students’ current EFL postgraduate theses writing (M=4.32). Twenty-nine 
participants (93.5%) acknowledged that prior EFL academic writing had helped them in their 
thesis writing. Influences were felt on developing knowledge about academic writing, the 
discipline, and thesis genre. 
 
The experience of writing the bachelor's and MA thesis gave me some very broad ideas 
about how I am going to think and write through the lenses of the discipline. Not from my 
personal subjective perspectives, but through the lenses of disciplinary knowledge.  
(Amy, Interview) 
 
Interestingly, the participants had some conflicting views on the influence of their 
first language academic writing experience. Eighteen participants thought that previous 
academic writing in their first language had contributed to their current thesis writing ability. 
This positive influence was perceived particularly in argumentative strategies and a proper 
choice of words. 
 
This ability might be benefited from my Chinese writing. From those writing, I practiced 
how to use proper words to express my thoughts. (Tom, Narratives) 
My Chinese teacher trained us how to get high scores in writing exams. That training helped 
me develop my academic writing ability, not just first language writing but also a second or 
foreign language writing. 
 
 
 
 
         (Lucy, Narratives) 
 
Against this view, the negative impact of the first language was pointed out by two 
Indonesian participants on EFL thesis writing.  
 
It’s my Indonesian style. We tend to explain everything in too many details. So, sometimes 
we lost the focus of what the data tell, or what is the main finding of this data. This is kind 
of my weakness. This is the nature of our language. Many words can be shortened, but we 
tend to make longer and longer. This influenced me a lot in the writing style.  
(John, Interview)  
 
These experiences added to the writers’ repertoire of textual practices, consequently 
forming genres they were more familiar with and ways of dividing the text, and so on.

The participants conceptualized their thesis writing through their understanding of 
academic writing. They defined academic writing as professional and formal writing in a third-
person tone, discussing the findings straightforwardly with objective data, and closely related 
to a higher level of English proficiency. Thus, storytelling and narratives were not academic 
writing but “writing with daily language” (Emma, Interview). The participants considered that 
discursive features such as terminology, passive voice, formal writing style, and citation 
techniques are the elements of writing a thesis. This kind of conceptualizing of thesis writing 
as writing objectively restricted writers’ choices. Consciously or unconsciously, the thesis 
writers wrote in such a way that they thought would make their theses more acceptable by 
academia. For example, Daniel tried to make his thesis “more academic like” by “using passive 
voice” and “avoiding using ‘I’,” while Murray followed her supervisor’s suggestions and “went 
directly to the point.”  
In this specific context of thesis writing, how the thesis writer understands academic 
writing became his standard to judge the writing, good or bad, academic or non-academic. One 
instance is that Tom downplayed his bachelor’s and master’s degree theses as “not academic 
writing at all”; therefore, in his current thesis writing, he tried to “avoid doing like that” and 
wrote “as objective as possible by listing all the facts and giving examples” (from Written 
Narrative). Furthermore, their conceptualizations shaped a sense of their roles as thesis writers. 
The interviewees labeled themselves as a “recorder,” “writing machine,” “part of research 
tool,” or “presenter of information.” For example, Fanny took the position of an “outsider” to 
describe objectively what happened during her research.  
 
I want to make me in an objective position, so to keep myself away from this experiment. I try to 
write like a third party. I don't want to make myself too subjective. So, I tried to tell the story 
like an outsider.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
            (Fanny) 
 
A sense of self-worth deals with how assured the thesis writers feels. Table 3 shows 
the average confidence in the role of writer in English (M=3.54). A positive emotional response 
to EFL doctoral thesis writing was accordingly expressed, through words like “pleasant”, 
“smooth”, “easy”, “fluent”, “excited”, “happy”, “confident”, and so on. Experience in 
academic writing, English language proficiency, and positive feedback were the sources of this 
confidence-building in writing. However, thirteen of the participants (41.9%) responded with 
a neutral answer, and one (3.2%) claimed a lack of confidence in their thesis writing. Problems 
were reported at vocabulary, sentence, and paragraph level; how to organize the ideas 
coherently and logically of particular concern. For example, Laura’s performance was 
recognized by her professor in her apprenticeship in a university in America. However, this 
confidence was destroyed following negative comments from her supervisor. Laura’s 
supervisor was not satisfied with her writing, which was apparent from his grading of her thesis 
proposal drafts: 
 
For the first time, he gave me F-. I was quite shocked why he gave me F and even F-. I rewrote 
my proposal and submitted it to him again. After four times I submitted with him, I still got E.  
(Interview) 
 
Being shocked, Laura even did not dare to ask her supervisor why. These negative and 
harsh comments increased her uncertainty in writing: 
 
This is quite hard This kind of feeling makes me worry more about my writing. I check before I 
send it to my supervisor. Every time.

On the contrary, the participants who received positive and encouraging feedback 
perceived themselves as writers more confidently. In her narrative, Amy reflected her “smooth 
and pleasant” journey and called herself “a fluent writer.” She explained in the interview that 
her supervisor’s encouraging notes inspired her and boosted her confidence in writing. Her 
supervisor was never hesitant in showing his satisfaction with Amy’s writing: 
 
He will definitely tell me “you should be proud of this part,” or “this part is very well written.” 
For me, these are very encouraging notes.  
 
 
 
 (Amy, Written Narrative) 
 
Praise won out when it came to promoting a writers’ sense of self-worth.  
The participants attributed these difficulties to the social identity they shared. Most 
participants (77.4%) thought the fact that English was used as a foreign language per se caused 
them difficulties in writing a thesis in English. This opinion was further confirmed in the 
following interviews. For example, some participants thought being a non-native English 
speaker limited their proficiency in “playing with the language” (Fanny, Interview) and always 
caused anxiety: 
 
I don’t feel confident. I'm not a native English speaker, so, I still have some mistakes in the 
sentences.

Most of the participants adopted the role of researcher before that of doctoral student. 
Working experience as a researcher provided the confidence to call oneself a researcher. 
Moreover, it was easier for the participants from the Schools of Physics, Food Technology, 
Biotechnology, Preclinical, and Environmental Engineering to accept the position of a 
researcher. Some participants did not distinguish between the two roles. They positioned 
themselves as doctoral students who had to write a thesis in order to graduate, meanwhile, 
novice researchers contributed to the development of knowledge in their discipline. However, 
self-effacement was evident from these two interviewees.  
 
I do not see myself as a researcher. Researcher is a very respectful identity. It’s very far away 
from my identity.

They said they have their traditional ways of writing thesis. I should follow them. So, I am not a

DISCOURSAL SELF 
 
The discoursal self is the impression a writer conveys of himself in his written text. The 
descriptive analysis (see Table 4) showed a strong awareness of constructing discoursal self in 
EFL doctoral thesis writing. First, the participants recognized the importance of showing voice. 
They tried to put their real voice into the writing (M=3.48), intended to portray a professional 
writer’s image to the readers (M=3.68), and embedded their own values and beliefs were 
embedded in their writing (M=4.00).

The participants’ desire to build a unique discoursal self was displayed in developing 
their ways of writing and organizing their ideas. For instance,  
 
Everyone has his own writing style. Someone else in our group, if he has the same experience, 
he may write the thesis with similar content, but in a very different writing style.              (Tyler) 
I came up with the best way to develop my thesis.    
 
 
 
 (Amy) 
 
Thesis writers insisted their writing should be generally acceptable to the mainstream 
of academia. In this sense, writing “objectively” was mentioned as a standard for writing up 
scientific research, “at least for face validity” (Tom) and “without any human touches” (Amy). 
Furthermore, this objective writing was implemented by avoiding self-mention, considering 
readers’ interests, using discursive features appropriately, and formatting as required.  
Second, the findings showed the thesis writers’ consideration of the readers’ interest 
(see Table 5). On the one hand, writing to self-please was placed centrally (M=4.19). With only 
three participants carving out a neutral position, twenty-eight participants (87.1%) wrote their 
theses in a way that would please themselves as readers. When being asked about this, Daniel 
and Bess particularly emphasized that working on the issues of interest motivated them and 
gave them self-satisfaction so they could move on to the next stages. On the other hand, 
nineteen of the participants (61.3%) considered their readers’ interests. A simplified form of 
language was used by some participants to make their writing easier to read.

The participants presumed quite a narrow readership of their thesis, including 
supervisors, thesis examiners, and maybe a few fellow graduate students in their discipline. It 
is worth noting that the graduate thesis writers clearly recognized the higher social status of 
their anticipated readers which would increase their power in relations. Bearing this power 
relationship in mind, they modified their methods of presentation and organised their texts 
accordingly according to their supervisors’ suggestions and the expectations of their thesis 
committee members.  
 
I wanted to make it as objective as possible and to avoid subjective things. I list all the facts, I 
used many examples, I quoted to support my ideas. I am even very careful about the format, the 
page number, the wording, because I want to persuade the committee members it seems good.

Third, the participants claimed they owned their theses. This sense of ownership was 
represented through their selection of research topics, their ways of developing ideas, and their 
word choices. Discursive features were employed to construct the discoursal self. Hedges were 
reported as being frequently used by twenty of the participants (64.5%). Word choices reflected 
their discoursal selves in the written discourses. Eighteen of the participants (58.1%) believed 
their language choices reflected themselves. Meanwhile, the participants admitted the influence 
of external voices on their discoursal construction of identity. Their supervisors’ feedback 
directly influenced their feelings and determined their writing styles.  
 
AUTHORIAL SELF 
 
The authorial self is concerned with a writer’s sense of authoritativeness in writing. Descriptive 
statistics (see Table 6) indicated that the participants held some conflicting opinions about 
developing self as the authors of their theses. They adopted a robust authorial stance and firmly 
claimed their authorship of the theses (M=3.94). Twenty-five of the participants (80.6 %) 
believed their voices should be conveyed through their theses. Most of the participants claimed 
their ideas (Mean = 3.68), which showed they strongly asserted their positions. In addition, a 
strong sense of self as an author was revealed from the general self-confidence in expressing 
their ideas (Mean=3.84). At last, a high mean score of 4.32 showed that the majority of the 
participants researched the topics of their interest.  
In contrast to this strong desire for an authorial presence, there was a lack of 
authoritativeness realized through actual writing. Self-mention was seldom used (M=1.81): 
only two participants used the proper noun “I” to refer to themselves in their theses. The 
participants stamped their authorship on their writings to a very limited extent (M=1.87). 
Twenty-six thesis writers (83.9%) cited many previous studies and attributed arguments to 
researchers who they thought were more authoritative.

The findings from the interview data further revealed this conflict between the 
authority that was desired and that which was actually conveyed. On the one hand, the 
interviewees claimed the authority for what they had researched and written. For instance, 
Emma mentioned the novelty of her study, and Jack expressed confidence in his contributions 
to his study. Their great efforts in research for their theses and their writing increased their 
confidence in claiming ideas.  
On the other hand, the thesis writers tended to avoid self-mention as it was considered 
inappropriate and thus definitely unacceptable to the participants from the hard science 
disciplines. The belief of "never using I" was deeply rooted in their classroom or acquired from 
the readings. Writing without referring to the researcher personally (e.g. ‘I’) was believed to 
help avoid subjective bias. For example, Tyler believed the primary function of writing in 
scientific research was to record and interpret the results objectively. Even the writers from the

Social Sciences seldom used first-person pronouns. Although they admitted being exposed to 
research articles in which “I” or “we” were employed, they refused to do the same in their own 
thesis writing. Only two participants used “I” to refer to themselves. However, one said she 
used “I” only when she had no other choice, and the other deleted “I” in her later writing after 
her supervisor directly showed his “dislike” of such a usage. The findings also showed a general 
tendency to align one’s studies to those of established research writers. Citation was frequently 
adopted to make the writing appear more academic, the arguments more persuasive, or simply 
to play safe: 
 
I provide my idea directly, and then give some citation or reference to support it. That is what I 
was taught. Because this is thesis writing, I must use many citations, references, to show that I 
have read many research papers, I have done much literature review, that is very objective, not 
subjective.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
            (Daniel)  
I got my own ideas first, then I searched the sources that have the same ideas with mine. I used 
their voice to express my own voice, to make me safe.  
 
 
 
 (Tom) 
 
As these examples show, the thesis writers considered quotation to be essential in thesis 
writing. Citation was a means of demonstrating what other researchers believe in the discipline. 
As graduate students, they wanted to apply what they had learned previously. Also, as 
newcomers to academia they felt the need of the authority of expert researchers. They followed 
the conventions of academic writing. 
 
POSSIBILITIES OF SELFHOOD 
 
Possibilities of selfhood are the options available for writers to construct a sense of themselves 
as appropriate in the sociocultural context. The participants had acquired knowledge of the 
thesis genre (see Table 7). They knew the possible ways of writing a thesis in a university 
setting and tried to follow them. For the eight items in this group, the mean scores ranged from 
3.03 to 4.00.

A frequency analysis supported the findings mentioned above. Within a broad social 
setting, almost all the participants had learned what kind of thesis was recognized as good in 
their disciplines. Similarly, they knew about the main characteristics of a thesis genre. Twenty-
nine participants (93.6%) were familiar with the components of a thesis, while twenty-five 
(80.6%) had read graduate theses in their disciplines to learn how to write a thesis. Twenty-
three thesis writers (74.2%) acknowledged that they knew and observed the rules of thesis 
writing in their schools. The participants held opposing views in their responses to the 
statement, “there is usually one best way to write a thesis.” The statistics tended to show 
extreme binary opinions: ten participants (32.2%) agreed with the statement above, while

eleven of the others (35.5%) disagreed. Twenty-seven of the participants (87.1%) had thought 
about the theses’ readability.  
The participants had developed an awareness of the discourse communities to which 
they belonged. They had learned the disciplinary conventions from academic writing courses, 
reading, and attending international conferences. Thus, they had consolidated a knowledge of 
the conventions used in practice. Lexical choices, syntactic forms, and textual structures were 
well-established within their disciplines: 
 
People all over the world who do Physics, when we write the papers or theses, we all follow the 
same models, same structure.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Tyler) 
Because of these established writing patterns, some participants did not, therefore, 
consider writing a thesis difficult or did not encounter struggles in thesis writing. Overall, the 
thesis writers believed their familiarity with disciplinary conventions was an advantage. These 
conventions allowed them certain options and provided them with appropriate linguistic 
features.  
By comparison with the established norms within their disciplines, they acquired 
knowledge of the expectations on thesis writing of their institutions relatively implicitly. Some 
participants complained about difficulties in figuring out the thesis format. The university 
provided the format, but the guidelines were written in Thai, but as they could not read Thai, 
they had no choice but to follow the formats used by their seniors. Daniel commented on this, 
“even the format of the thesis I just got from the seniors or classmates.” In addition, some 
participants mentioned the “invisible game rules” in thesis writing (Tom). Through observation 
and listening to “gossip” from fellow students, thesis writers found out about the unspoken 
concerns of faculty members regarding thesis writing. Supervisors and thesis committee 
members were considered representatives of the localized institutional discourse community 
to whom their theses would be addressed.  
        The participants felt that both the disciplinary and institutional options should be provided 
to them explicitly. They realized that they had to learn what and how they should write their 
theses in an appropriate form. Most of them chose to follow the conventions under the pressure 
of being able to graduate, because of their concerns about remaining student researchers and 
avoiding conflicts with their supervisors. However, the existence of conventions should offer 
options rather than constraints.  
 
Conventions are formed because people are doing things in the community. They form this kind 
of habit, or maybe the most effective ways to contribute their knowledge to the disciplines. And 
for us, new researchers, or new writers to the communities, we must know and understand the 
conventions. Only when we have a full understanding of the conventions, we can make full use 
of that in our own way, then we can play with the conventions.

DISCUSSION: SELF-ADJUSTMENT AND SOCIAL ACCULTURATION 
 
Following the conceptual framework of “four aspects of writer identity” (Ivanič, 1998), this 
study found that the desired scholarly writer identity was dynamically constructed through 
integrating multiple aspects of self-presentation (Burgess & Ivanič, 2010; Ivanič, 1998; Li & 
Deng, 2019; Matsuda, 2015). Next, we will discuss the writers’ integration of self-adjustment 
and social acculturation. 
Self-adjustment is the writer’s interaction with oneself. In a processual view (Lemke, 
2002), we admit the shifting nature of writer identity and take thesis writing as a continuously 
changing process of self-identification (Burgess & Ivanič, 2010). The autobiographical self is 
what doctoral students bring to the thesis writing process. The participants possess different

autobiographies, particularly in terms of development in their academic writing ability, 
conceptualization of thesis writing, and sense of self-worth.  
Due to different levels of exposure to English academic writing practices, the 
participants had experienced a variety of English backgrounds and consequently defined 
themselves as either “good” or “bad” writers. Consequently, this self-concept may have 
brought them a feeling of ease or anxiety in writing. The participants continuously identified 
their writing in terms of what they considered to be a “good” thesis. They attempted to adjust 
and make their writings become more thesis like.  
Self-worth is always a problem for non-native English speakers’ identity because 
they worry a great deal about the quality of their writing. There is a constant fear of feeling 
“deficient compared to speakers of ‘standard’ English” (Norton & De Costa, 2018, p. 101). A 
general lack of confidence in writing was reported by the participants. However, the evidence 
provided does not reveal a distinct impact of one’s first language on constructing an authorial 
identity (Matsuda, 2001; Zhao, 2019). Meanwhile, self-worth is dynamic in that assurance in 
writing changes with the development of thesis writing. One interesting finding is how others’ 
labeling of thesis writers contributes to their self-identification. Negative external voices 
deconstruct a thesis writers’ confidence and make him/her more cautious in making 
grammatical mistakes and using illogical expressions. In contrast, approval of one’s writing 
promotes positive emotions and boosts the confidence of the thesis writers.  
Therefore, we argue that the three major points of the autobiographical self, as 
mentioned above, influence the participants’ discoursal construction of self and authorial 
presence. The participants’ understanding of what is a good thesis in the discipline influences 
their discourse choices, such as word choices, sentence structures, writing styles, and ways of 
formatting the texts. These choices ultimately determine the image of the doctoral writers 
conveyed in the written text. Our findings are consistent with those of Li & Deng (2019) in that 
aspects of self-representation share different roles. However, constructing an authorial self in 
an EFL doctoral thesis differs from those used in the writing of personal statements. Despite 
being proposed as a significant presentation of authorial self (Hyland 2001; Ivanič & Camps, 
2001), self-mention was seldom accepted or utilized by the participants. This can be interpreted 
as a signal of a desire, consciously or unconsciously, to avoid the use of the autobiographical 
self in thesis writing. Citation was frequently used because this is a well-established convention 
for thesis writers to follow.  
Social acculturation refers to the participation of EFL postgraduate thesis writers in 
social interactions. The participants struggled to develop a voice and establish their desired 
identity. An awareness of discourse communities is valuable in establishing the identity of 
successful thesis writers. Like most EFL learners in non-English speaking countries, the 
participants have rarely been informed of the notion of textual construction of voice (Zhao, 
2014). However, the participants learned through their academic practice that a thesis speaks 
to a particular readership. The desire to obtain membership of the academic discourse 
community motivated the participants to acculturate themselves into the social context. Both 
disciplinary and institutional possibilities of selfhood provided options rather than constraints 
on the participants’ EFL doctoral thesis writing.  
As novice writers, the doctoral students welcomed overt instruction of these “game 
rules.” Most participants chose to accommodate themselves to what they perceived as 
privileged patterns in the institution. The negative side of this passive alignment leads to an 
actual distancing from discoursal construction of writer identity: the participants tend to tone 
down their voice, which could be observed from the rare use of self-mention, using hedges, 
and frequent citations. Also, the role of doctoral students hinders them from revealing their 
opinions. Feeling inferior in the disciplinary community, the thesis writers dared not claim their 
ideas without referring to recognized expert members. Their expected readers were restricted

to supervisors and thesis committee members. Although mostly passive, the students’ 
compliance with conventions were conditional. The researcher’s role, even for novices, should 
be more overtly promoted because a doctoral thesis is expected to uncover new knowledge 
(Starfield & Paltridge, 2019). Social acculturation can also be found in writers’ efforts in 
finding their way towards developing a thesis, considering the readers’ interests, and discussion 
from a critical perspective. To some extent, this echoes Hyland & Tse’s (2012) idea that 
socially enabled conventions provide writers not only with particular ways to represent 
themselves, but also opportunities to “negotiate new positions” (p. 156). 
Although writer identity consists of four different aspects, the autobiographical self 
and the possibilities of self-hood stand out as the most dominant categories in constructing the 
participants’ identities. These two aspects interplay and work together to determine the 
discoursal self and the extent to which authoritativeness is shown. The autobiographical self is 
the accumulated experiences of the writers’ being exposed to the socially available options. 
The type of social possibilities to which the writers have access is vital. The participants whose 
writing quality has been appraised by their supervisors, thesis committee members, or fellow 
students have acquired more confidence in their writing styles. However, the student writers 
whose writing abilities are not acknowledged by themselves or others, struggle more for self-
presentation with limited available options. This finding shares some similarities with the claim 
of Burgess & Ivanič (2010) who argued that if a writer experiences the possibilities of selfhood 
in which he is treated without an authorial role at all, it is likely that he will develop a sense of 
inferiority in his autobiographical self. Such a feeling may discourage the writer in engaging 
in writing and lead his writing “in a militant way” (p. 246).  
According to Burgess & Ivanič (2010), multiple selves are constructed “by writers' 
selection of particular discoursal characteristics in the design of their texts” (p.235). The 
language choices are enabled by the possibilities for selfhood (Ivanič, 1998). This means that 
self-representations are enacted in the process of selecting appropriate ways of writing. The 
thesis writers cannot construct their voice from an infinite repertoire of possibilities. The 
resources are not only culturally available as explained in the literature (Ivanič & Camps, 2001; 
Matsuda, 2001, 2015; Tardy, 2012) but also varied for individual writers. Personal histories, 
especially in academic literary activities, are greatly affected by exposure to the conventions. 
These conventions of thesis writing provide choices which confine students’ writings within 
the norms.   
 
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS 
 
Writer identity is constructed through self-adjusting one’s writing practice to the existing 
conventions and through a process of social acculturation into the target academic discourse 
community. Unlike their native speaker counterparts, the participants’ sense of being EFL users 
influences their identity construction in terms of self-worth, confidence in writing, and 
responses to the conventions of writing. Most of the participants had not been sufficiently 
exposed to the concept of authorial representation. Lacking awareness of authorship is one 
reason why the participants passively followed the disciplinary conventions and the 
expectations of their institutions. It is this passive alignment that causes an actual distancing 
from the discoursal construction of writer identity. Self-marginalization as EFL learners, 
negative external voices, and the role of student writer most hinder the development and 
representation of the authorial self. 
The current study provides the following implications. Firstly, this study brings 
potential enlightenment to exploring the experience of EFL doctoral thesis writing in non-
native English-speaking contexts. Secondly, this research helps enrich the literature on writer 
identity. It contends that the autobiographical self and the possibilities of selfhood should be

more addressed in the construction of writer identity in EFL doctoral theses. However, due 
to the limited sample of EFL doctoral thesis writers at a university in Thailand, the findings 
may not be generalized to thesis writer identity construction in other EFL educational 
contexts. Besides, the L2 Writer Identity Survey was adapted from Ruggles (2012) and 
designed with the conceptual framework of four aspects of writer identity. After checking the 
validity and reliability, the survey was piloted and modified. However, the survey needs to be 
administrated to a larger number of participants, including those thesis writers at an 
undergraduate level or a Master’s level. In this light, it might help validate the results and 
perpetuate more authentic voices of writers. The application of this research instrument to 
further research should be cautious.
