Disciplinary voices
Interactions in research writing
Ken Hyland
University of London
The concept of voice has become central to studies of discourse, composition, 
and literature, but in this paper I want to shift its meaning a little to explore an 
area where voice is thought to play only a minor role: that of academic writ-
ing. I intend here to explore the idea of ‘disciplinary voice’ by focusing on the 
interpersonal features of academic writing and elaborating how writers position 
themselves and their readers. Essentially, I believe the idea of voice can shed light 
on aspects of disciplinary argument and am interested to see what these features 
tell us about writers’ notions of appropriate relationships and what this means 
for writing in the disciplines. I will begin by looking briefly at the notion of 
voice, and go on to sketch an interactional model based on the ideas of stance, or 
how writers convey their attitudes and credibility, and engagement, or the ways 
they bring their readers into the discourse. I will then show how the choices 
writers make from these systems construct authorial voice, academic arguments, 
and the disciplines themselves.
1.	 The notion of Voice
The term ‘voice’ is often used to refer to the ways writers express their personal 
views, authoritativeness, and presence. It is common for teachers to say, “I can re-
ally hear your voice in this piece of writing”, for example, meaning that they have 
a strong sense of the writer’s views. Academic writing, however, is a site where this 
sense of voice is generally unwelcome as readers often look for evidence rather 
than opinion. As a result, students learn to efface their personalities when they 
write and science has numerous ways of removing the author from a text and dis-
tancing interpretation from explanation.
But while this meaning of ‘voice’ has attracted most attention in the literature, 
it isn’t the one I am concerned with here. I want to emphasize that writing always 
has voice in the sense that it conveys a representation of the writer. In this sense,

writing can’t not have voice. ‘Voice’, then, is not an optional extra but an aspect 
of how we position ourselves in relation to our communities. In other words, we 
should see all writing as containing ‘voice’ in the Bakhtinian sense of ‘voice types’ 
which locate users culturally and historically. As writers we show who we are by 
the choices we make in our texts in much the same way that our speech, clothes 
and body language index our social class, occupation, group memberships and so 
on. Equally, however, writers do not construct these self-representations from an 
infinite range of possibilities, just pulling on an identity from the wardrobe, but 
draw on culturally available resources when they write. They make choices which 
align them with one discipline rather than another.
In other words, we achieve a voice through the ways we negotiate representa-
tions of ourselves and take on the discourses of our communities. So this notion 
of voice as self-representation subsumes the traditional view of voice as authorita-
tiveness. But it does not eradicate personal choice in how we express ourselves. We 
still decide how aggressive, conciliatory, confident, or self-effacing we want to be. 
In other words, we do not sacrifice a personal voice by writing in the disciplines — 
we just recognise the boundaries which constrain it and which give it meaning in 
contrast to other possible choices.
2.	 Disciplinary voices
The idea that voice is essentially social rather than personal is an important one 
for understanding academic writing and the ways persuasion is achieved in differ-
ent fields. It also enables us as teachers to identify the features typical of writing in 
particular disciplines to better help our students control valued ways of writing. 
The concept of ‘voice’ helps us to understand how writers typically position them-
selves and their work in relation to other members of their groups. Writers set out 
their ideas to negotiate a credible account of themselves and their work by claim-
ing solidarity with readers, evaluating ideas and acknowledging alternative views, 
so that controlling their disciplinary voice, or level of authorized personality in a 
text, becomes central to building a convincing discourse. This view sees academics 
as not only producing texts that plausibly represent an external reality, but using 
language to acknowledge, construct and negotiate social relations. Put succinctly, 
every successful academic text displays the writer’s awareness of both its readers 
and its consequences.
Persuasion, then, is accomplished with language; but it is language that dem-
onstrates legitimacy. Writers must recognize and make choices from the rhetorical 
options available in their fields so they can convey a persona and appeal to readers 
from within the boundaries of their disciplines. The notion of voice is therefore

closely related to that of interaction, and especially to the ways we convey our 
personal feelings and assessments.
This understanding of voice has become a heavily populated area of research 
in recent years and has been conducted under various labels, including ‘evaluation’ 
(Hunston 1994, Hunston and Thompson 2000), ‘intensity’ (Labov 1984), ‘affect’ 
(Ochs 1989), ‘evidentiality’ (Chafe and Nichols 1986), ‘hedging’ (Hyland 1998), and 
‘stance’ (Biber and Finegan 1989; Conrad and Biber 2000). The expression of evalu-
ation and stance in academic research writing has been especially productive (e.g. 
Bondi 1999; Hunston 1994; Hyland 2001a) and much of this work focuses on features 
such as the use of hedging devices to express tentativeness and possibility (Hyland 
1998), authorial self-mention (Hyland 2001b) and reporting verbs (Thompson and 
Ye 1991; Hyland 2000). This line of research has been extended by looking at how 
authors actively try to involve the reader in the communication process through the 
use of addressee features (Hyland 2001) and directives (Hyland 2002a).
All of these features in some way address the idea of ‘positioning’ and in aca-
demic writing this means adopting a point of view to both the issues discussed 
in the text and to others who hold points of view on those issues. Writers have to 
display a competence as disciplinary insiders to be persuasive and this is, at least in 
part, achieved through a writer-reader dialogue which situates both their research 
and themselves. This means adopting a disciplinary voice; using language which 
establishes relationships between people, and between people and ideas. In other 
words, claims for the significance and originality of research have to be balanced 
against the convictions and expectations of readers, taking into account their likely 
objections, background knowledge, rhetorical expectations and processing needs. 
All this is done within the broad constraints of disciplinary discourses.
3.	 Stance and engagement
Interactions are accomplished in academic writing through the systems of stance 
and engagement. Stance refers to the writer’s textual ‘voice’ or community recogn-
ised personality, an attitudinal, writer-oriented function which concerns the ways 
writers present themselves and convey their judgements, opinions, and commit-
ments. Engagement, on the other hand, is more of an alignment function, con-
cerning the ways that writers rhetorically recognise the presence of their readers 
to actively pull them along with the argument, include them as discourse partici-
pants, and guide them to interpretations (Hyland 2001a). Together, they recognise 
that statements need to both present the writer and his or her ideas as well as 
anticipate readers’ possible objections and alternative positions, incorporating an 
appropriate awareness of self and audience.

Stance and engagement are two sides of the same coin and, because they both 
contribute to the interpersonal dimension of discourse, there are overlaps between 
them. Discrete categories inevitably conceal the fact that forms often perform 
more than one function at once because, in developing their arguments, writers 
are simultaneously trying to set out a claim, comment on its truth, establish soli-
darity and represent their credibility. In addition, the marking of stance and en-
gagement is a highly contextual matter as writers can employ evaluations through 
a shared attitude towards particular methods or theoretical orientations which 
may be opaque to the analyst. Nor is it always marked by words at all: a writer’s de-
cision not to draw an obvious conclusion from an argument, for example, may be 
read by peers as a significant absence (Swales 2004). The present study is therefore 
restricted to grammatical devices that express stance and engagement, identifying 
predominant meanings to compare the rhetorical patterns in different discourse 
communities. The key resources by which these interactional macro-functions are 
realised are summarised in Figure 1.
Together, these resources have a dialogic purpose in that they refer to, antici-
pate, or otherwise take up the actual or anticipated voices and positions of poten-
tial readers (Bakhtin 1986). Distinguishing between these two dimensions is a use-
ful starting point from which to explore how voice operates and how interaction 
contributes to persuasion in academic discourse.
4.	 Corpus and Methods
The description has emerged through studies I have conducted over the last decade 
into a corpus of 240 research articles of 1.4 million words. This corpus was selected 
to represent a broad cross-section of academic practice and comprises three papers 
from each of ten leading journals in eight disciplines. The fields are mechanical en-
gineering (ME), electrical engineering (EE), marketing (Mk), philosophy (Phil), 
sociology (Soc), applied linguistics (AL), physics (Phy) and microbiology (Bio).

These sub-corpora were searched for 320 potentially productive items based on 
previous research, grammars and the most frequently occurring items in the texts 
themselves. The analyses were supplemented with interviews with experienced 
writers from the target disciplines to discover respondents’ attitudes about writ-
ing and their own discoursal preferences and practices. The next sections briefly 
sketch out the key resources of stance and engagement. Then I go on to discuss 
what differences in their use tell us about the epistemological and social beliefs of 
disciplinary cultures.
5.	 Stance and writer-oriented interaction
Stance concerns writer-oriented features of interaction and conveys different 
kinds of personal feelings and assessments, including attitudes that writers have 
about particular information, how certain they are about its veracity, how they 
obtained access to it, and what perspective they are taking to it and to the reader. I 
take it to have three main components: evidentiality, affect and presence. Evidenti-
ality refers to the writer’s expressed commitment to the reliability of the proposi-
tions he or she presents and their potential impact on the reader; affect involves 
a broad range of personal and professional attitudes towards what is said; and 
presence simply concerns the extent to which the writer chooses to project him 
or herself into the text. It is comprised of four elements: hedges, boosters, attitude 
markers and self-mention, which I will briefly describe below.
Hedges are devices which withhold complete commitment to a proposition, 
allowing information to be presented as an opinion rather than fact (Hyland 1998). 
They imply that a claim is based on plausible reasoning rather than certain knowl-
edge and so both indicate the degree of confidence it might be wise to attribute 
to a claim while allowing writers to open a discursive space for readers to dispute 
interpretations. This is an example from biology:
	
(1)	 We propose several possible reasons for this: (1) pressures increase upon 
freezing and thus may force bubbles back into solution at the time of thaw; 
(2) since xylem water is degassed by freezing there is a strong tendency for 
bubbles to redissolve at the time of thaw; and (3) xylem water may flow in 
advance of ice formation and could refill some of the previously embolized 
vessels. (Bio)
Boosters, on the other hand, allow writers to express their certainty in what they 
say and to mark involvement with the topic and solidarity with their audience 
(Hyland 2005). While they restrict opportunities for alternative voices, they also 
often stress shared information and group membership as we tend to get behind 


## Page 6

those ideas which have a good chance of being accepted. Like hedges, they often 
occur in clusters, underlining the writer’s conviction in an argument:
	
(2)	 Of course, I do not contend that there are no historical contingencies. On 
the contrary, the role of contingencies should be stressed. If there were no 
contingencies, there would be no innovations, whether scientific or moral. 
On this point, we must definitely stop following Hegel’s intuitions. Nobody 
can foretell that tomorrow totalitarian regimes will not reappear and 
eventually spread over the planet. (Soc)
Both boosters and hedges represent a writer’s response to the potential viewpoints 
of readers and an acknowledgement of disciplinary norms of appropriate argu-
ment. Both strategies emphasise that statements don’t just communicate ideas, but 
also the writer’s attitude to them and to readers.
	
Attitude markers indicate the writer’s affective, rather than epistemic, 
attitude to propositions, conveying surprise, agreement, importance, frustration, 
and so on, rather than commitment. Attitude can be expressed in a wide range of 
ways, as Martin (2000) and White (2002) have attempted to show by mapping the 
options available to speakers in conveying affect in their model of appraisal. Atti-
tude is most explicitly signalled by attitude verbs, sentence adverbs, and adjectives, 
and this marking of attitude in academic writing allows writers both take a stand 
and align themselves with disciplinary-oriented value positions.
	
(3)	 No doubt there are a number of criticisms that adherents to the justice-
based paradigm might make of the moral model Dworkin proposes. Still, 
I believe that Dworkin’s investment model has remarkable resonance and 
extraordinary potential power. The worry I have about Dworkin’s proposal 
arises from inside his model. It is interesting right off the bat to notice that … 
(Phil)
Self-mention refers to the use of first person pronouns and possessive adjectives to 
present information (Hyland 2001b). Presenting a discoursal self is central to the 
writing process (Ivanic 1998), and we cannot avoid projecting an impression of 
ourselves and how we stand in relation to our arguments, discipline, and readers. 
The presence or absence of explicit author reference is a conscious choice by writ-
ers to adopt a particular stance and disciplinary-situated authorial identity.
	
(4)	 Our investigation of writing at the local government office comprised an 
analysis of the norms and attitudes of each individual. We asked the different 
employees about their norms concerning a good text and a good writer. We 
also asked them about their attitudes toward writing at work. What we found 
interesting about this context, however, is the degree of uniformity of their 
norms and attitudes. (Soc)

6.	 Engagement and reader-oriented interaction
Unlike stance, the ways writers bring readers into the discourse have been relative-
ly neglected in the literature. Engagement seeks to build a connection with read-
ers to both stress solidarity and position them by anticipating possible objections 
and guiding their thinking. Based on their previous experiences with texts, writers 
make predictions about how readers are likely to react to their arguments and craft 
their texts to explicitly address them at certain points (Hyland 2001a). Engage-
ment markers include reader pronouns, personal asides, references to sharedness, 
directives and questions.
Reader pronouns offer the most explicit ways of bringing readers into a dis-
course but you and your are rare in research articles, perhaps because they imply 
a separation between participants, rather than seeking connections, and this helps 
to account for the high use of inclusive we. There are several motivations for using 
this form, but most centrally it identifies the reader as someone who shares similar 
understandings to the writer as a member of the same discipline. At the same time 
as expressing peer solidarity, however, we also anticipates reader objections, pre-
suming mutual understandings while weaving the potential point of view of the 
reader into the argument.
Directives are mainly expressed through imperatives and obligation modals 
and they direct readers to engage in three main kinds of activity:
–	
textual acts: direct readers to another part of the text or to another text (e.g. see 
Smith 1999, refer to Table 2, etc.)
–	
physical acts direct readers how to carry out some action in the real-world (e.g. 
open the valve, heat the mixture).
–	
cognitive acts instruct readers how to interpret an argument, explicitly posi-
tioning readers by encouraging them to note, concede or consider some argu-
ment or claim in the text.
Personal asides allow writers to address readers directly by briefly interrupting 
the argument to offer a comment on what has been said. By turning to the reader 
in mid-flow, the writer acknowledges and responds to an active audience, often 
to initiate a brief dialogue that is largely interpersonal, adding more to the writer-
reader relationship than to propositional development:
	
(5)	 And — as I believe many TESOL professionals will readily acknowledge — 
critical thinking has now begun to make its mark, particularly in the area of 
L2 composition. (AL)

(6)	 He above all provoked the mistrust of academics, both because of his 
trenchant opinions (often, it is true, insufficiently thought out) and his 
political opinions. (Soc)
Appeals to shared knowledge are marked by explicit signals asking readers to recog-
nise something as familiar or accepted. These constructions of solidarity ask readers 
to identify with particular views and in so doing construct readers by assigning to 
them a role in creating the argument, acknowledging their contribution while mov-
ing the focus of the discourse away from the writer to shape the role of the reader:
	
(7)	 It is, of course, possible to realise capacitors using the inter-metal, 
linearmetal-poly, metal-diffusion, or poly diffusion (with an SiO2 dielectric) 
capacitances. (EE)
	
(8)	 This tendency obviously reflects the preponderance of brand-image 
advertising in fashion merchandising. (Mkt)
Questions are the main strategy of dialogic involvement, inviting engagement, 
encouraging curiosity and bringing interlocutors into an arena where they can be 
led to the writer’s viewpoint (Hyland 2002b). Over 80% of questions in the corpus, 
however, were rhetorical, presenting an opinion as an interrogative so the reader 
appears to be the judge, but actually expecting no response. This is most apparent 
when writers answer their question immediately:
	
(9)	 Is it, in fact, necessary to choose between nurture and nature? My contention 
is that it is not. (Soc)
	 (10)	 What do these two have in common, one might ask? The answer is that they 
share the same politics. (AL)
The process of audience evaluation involved in making choices from the options 
of stance and engagement clearly assists writers to construct an effective voice in 
their arguments, but in addition, it reveals something of how language is related to 
specific institutional contexts. In the remainder of this paper I explore what these 
choices tell us about disciplinary communities.
7.	 Stance and engagement: Disciplinary practices
Overall, it appears that the expression of stance and engagement is an important 
feature of academic writing, with about one occurrence every 28 words. Table 1 
shows that stance markers were about five times more common than engagement 
features and that hedges were by far the most frequent feature of writer perspec-
tive in the corpus, reflecting the critical importance of distinguishing fact from

opinion and the need for writers to present their claims with appropriate caution 
and regard to colleagues’ views.
When we compare these frequencies with other common features of published 
academic writing, we find that overt interaction markers are an important element 
of academic prose. Biber et al (1999), for instance, record 18.5 cases per thousand 
words for passive voice constructions and 20 per thousand words for past tense 
verbs in a large corpus of academic writing. More interesting, however, are the 
disciplinary distributions. Table 2 shows the density of features in each discipline 
normalised to a text length of 1,000 words. As can be seen, the more discursive 
‘soft’ fields of philosophy, marketing, sociology and applied linguistics contained 
the highest proportion of interactional markers with some 75% more items than 
the engineering and science papers.
I do not want to dwell on these frequencies, but it is clear that writers in dif-
ferent disciplines represent themselves, their work and their readers in different 
ways, with those in the humanities and social sciences taking far more explicitly 
involved and personal positions than those in the science and engineering fields. 
We do not have to search far for an explanation for this. As I noted at the begin-
ning of this paper, the resources of language mediate their contexts, working to 
construe the characteristic structures of knowledge domains and argument forms 
of the disciplines that create them. Most centrally, these discourse conventions 
embody the particular sets of values, practices and beliefs which are held by, and 
help define, academic disciplines.
In broad terms, rhetorical practices are inextricably related to the purposes of 
the disciplines. Natural scientists tend to see their goal as producing public knowl-
edge able to withstand the rigours of falsifiability and developed through relatively 
steady cumulative growth. The fact that this research often occupies considerable 
investments in money, training, equipment, and expertise means it is frequently 
concentrated at a few sites and commits scientists to involvement in specific re-
search areas for many years. Problems therefore emerge in an established context 
so that readers are often familiar with prior texts and research, and that the novelty

and significance of contributions can be easily recognised. The soft-knowledge 
domains, in contrast, produce discourses which often recast knowledge as sym-
pathetic understanding, promoting tolerance in readers through an ethical rather 
than cognitive progression (Hyland 2000).
8.	 Authorial involvement in knowledge construction
While there are clear dangers in reifying the ideologies of practitioners, these broad 
ontological representations have real rhetorical effects which are clear in the use of 
stance markers and particularly apparent in the use of hedges and self mention.
Both hedges and boosters tended to be more common in the humanities and 
social science papers with about 2½ times as many devices overall and hedges 
particularly strongly represented. This is mainly because the soft-knowledge fields 
are typically more interpretative and less abstract than the hard sciences and their 
forms of argument rely more on a dialogic engagement and more explicit recogni-
tion of alternative voices. Research is influenced far more by contextual factors, 
there is less control of variables, more diversity of research outcomes, and gener-
ally fewer unequivocal bases for accepting claims. Writers in the soft fields cannot 
therefore report their research with the same confidence of shared assumptions. 
They must rely far more on focusing readers on the claim-making negotiations of 
the discourse community, the arguments themselves, rather than relatively unme-
diated real-world phenomena.
This tends to mean that arguments have to be expressed more cautiously in 
the soft disciplines, remaining open to heteroglossic diversity in the community 
by using more hedges:

	 (11)	 Wilson leaves us disappointed, it seems to me, in the sense that his theory is 
far from being general. (Soc)
	 (12)	 We tentatively suggest that The Sun’s minimalist style creates an impression 
of working-class language, or restricted code, while the very wordy Times 
themes remind one of academic, formal discourse. (AL)
The fact that methodologies and results are more open to question also means that 
writers in the soft fields need to work harder to establish the significance of their 
work against alternative interpretations. As a result, they also have to restrict, or 
fend off, possible alternative voices, closing them down using boosters to emphasise 
the strength of the writer’s commitment and thereby convince the reader through 
the force of the argument. Two comments from informants typify this view:
You have to be seen to believe what you say. That they are your arguments. It’s what 
gives you credibility. It’s the whole point. (Phil interview)
I’m very much aware that I’m building a façade of authority when I write, I really 
like to get behind my work and get it out there. Strong. Committed. That’s the voice 
I’m trying to promote, even when I’m uncertain I want to be behind what I say. (Soc 
interview)
This kind of commitment is evident in these extracts:
	 (13)	 It is certainly true that many arguments involve multiple premises. (Phil)
	 (14)	 This particular result is undoubtedly attributable to the impending 
incorporation of Hong Kong into the People’s Republic of China. (Mk)
In the hard sciences, argument is very different as an important aspect of a positiv-
ist-empirical epistemology is that the authority of the individual is subordinated 
to the authority of the text and facts should be allowed to ‘speak for themselves’ 
(Hyland 1998). Writers generally seek to disguise both their interpretative respon-
sibilities and rhetorical identities behind linguistic objectivity. The less frequent 
use of hedges and boosters is one way of minimising the researcher’s role in this 
process, as is the preference for modal verbs over cognitive verbs such as think, 
believe and suspect, which downplay the person making the evaluation and can 
more easily combine with inanimate subjects:
	 (15)	 The theory given above simply provided some insight into the various 
mechanisms and configurations that might or might not yield a polarimetric 
effect. (Phy)
	 (16)	 There was a good correlation between the four values. For V. trifidum, 
ANOVA showed a significant increase from L to L’ and FI, which could be 
interpreted as reflecting the dynamics of fungal colonization. (Bio)

Two scientist informants commented on this kind of use:
Of course, I make decisions about the findings I have, but it is more convincing to tie 
them closely to the results. (Phy interview)
You have to relate what you say to your colleagues and we don’t encourage people to 
go out and nail their colours to the mast as maybe they don’t get it published. (Bio 
interview)
For similar reasons, we also find different uses of self mention across these do-
mains. The reason for this is that strategic use of self-mention allows writers to 
claim authority by expressing their convictions, emphasizing their contribution to 
the field, and seeking recognition for their work (Hyland 2001b; Kuo 1999). It sends 
a clear indication to the reader of the perspective from which statements should be 
interpreted, distinguishing the writer’s own work from that of others. It is not sur-
prising therefore that some 69% of all cases of self-mention were in the humanities 
and social science papers, with an average of 38 per article, compared with only 17 
per paper in science and engineering. Successful communication in the soft fields 
depends far more on the author’s ability to invoke a real writer in the text. As we 
can see in examples 17 and 18, personal reference is thus a clear indication of the 
perspective from which a statement should be interpreted, enabling writers to em-
phasize their own contribution to the field and to seek agreement for it.
	 (17)	 I argue that their treatment is superficial because, despite appearances, 
it relies solely on a sociological, as opposed to an ethical, orientation to 
develop a response. (Soc)
	 (18)	 I bring to bear on the problem my own experience. This experience contains 
ideas derived from reading I have done which might be relevant to my 
puzzlement as well as my personal contacts with teaching contexts. (AL)
So in the humanities and social sciences, self-mention can help construct an intel-
ligent, credible, and engaging colleague by presenting an authorial self reflecting 
an appropriate degree of confidence and authority:
Using ‘I’ emphasizes what you have done. What is yours in any piece of research.. I 
notice it in papers and use it a lot myself. (Soc interview)
The personal pronoun ‘I’ is very important in philosophy. It not only tells people 
that it is your own unique point of view, but that you believe what you are saying. 
It shows your colleagues where you stand in relation to the issues and in relation to 
where they stand on them. It marks out the differences. (Phil interview)
While the first person assists soft discipline authors to make a personal standing 
in their texts and to demarcate their own work from that of others, hard science

writers are generally seeking to downplay their personal role in the research to 
highlight the phenomena under study, the replicability of research activities, and 
the generality of the findings. Research usually consists of conducting experiments 
to propose solutions to specific disciplinary problems and typically involves fa-
miliar procedures, broadly predictable outcomes, and relatively clear criteria of 
acceptability. By electing to adopt a less intrusive or personal style, they suggest 
that research outcomes are unaffected by individuals, strengthening the objectivity 
of their interpretations and subordinating their own voice to that of nature. One of 
my respondents expressed this view clearly:
I feel a paper is stronger if we are allowed to see what was done without ‘we did this’ 
and ‘we think that’. Of course we know there are researchers there, making interpre-
tations and so on, but this is just assumed. It’s part of the background. I’m looking 
for something interesting in the study and it shouldn’t really matter who did what 
in any case.… In theory anyone should be able follow the same procedures and get 
the same results. Of course reputation is important and I often look at the writer 
before I look at a paper, but the important thing is whether the results seem right. 
(Bio interview)
9.	 Participant relationships and interpersonal engagement
In addition to creating an impression of authority, integrity and credibility through 
choices from the stance options, writers are able to either highlight or downplay 
the presence of their readers in the text. Engagement devices refer to the various 
ways writers bring readers into the discourse to relate to them and anticipate their 
possible objections. As shown in Table 2, these devices were far less frequent than 
stance items, but exhibited similar variation across disciplines.
Reader pronouns were the most frequent engagement items in the corpus and 
over 80% of these occurred in the soft discipline papers where they functioned to 
appeal to scholarly solidarity, presupposing a set of mutual, discipline-identifying 
understandings linking writer and reader.
	 (19)	 Adopting a reflexive and continuously critical approach towards ourselves 
and our sociological practices is especially necessary because our profession 
is an all-embracing calling that penetrates our self and collective identities, 
and serves for many of us as a functional equivalent of ideology or civil-
religion. (Soc)
	 (20)	 We would expect that over time, plant genotypes that maximize mycorrhizal 
benefits would be at a selective advantage. (Bio)

In addition, however, reader pronouns also claim authority as well as communal-
ity, addressing the reader from a position of confidence as several of my infor-
mants noted:
I suppose ‘we’ helps to finesse a positive response–we are all in this together kind of 
thing. I use it to signal that I am on the same wavelength, drawing on the same as-
sumptions and asking the same questions. (Mkt Interview)
It helps to locate you in a network. It shows that you are just doing and thinking 
what they might do and think. Or what you would like them to, anyway.	 (Soc in-
terview)
By weaving the potential point of view of readers into the discourse, writers are 
able to claim collegiality and authority as they anticipate reader objections, step-
ping in to voice their concerns and views. Thus we helps guide readers through an 
argument and towards a preferred interpretation, as can be seen here:
	 (21)	 Now that we have a plausible theory of depiction, we should be able to 
answer the question of what static images depict. But this turns out to be not 
at all a straightforward matter. We seem, in fact, to be faced with a dilemma. 
Suppose we say that static images can depict movement. This brings us into 
conflict with Currie’s account, … (Phil)
	 (22)	 Although we lack knowledge about a definitive biological function for the 
transcripts from the 93D locus, their sequences provide us with an ideal 
system to identify a specific transcriptionally active site in embryonic nuclei. 
(Bio)
Several of my informants were well aware of this more Machiavellian purpose:
Part of what you are doing in writing a paper is getting your readers onside, not just 
getting down a list of facts, but showing that you have similar interests and concerns. 
That you are looking at issues in much the same way they would, not spelling every-
thing out, but following the same procedures and asking the questions they might 
have. (Bio interview)
I often use ‘we’ to include readers. I suppose it brings out something of the collective 
endeavour, what we all know and want to accomplish. I’ve never thought of it as a 
strategy, but I suppose I am trying to lead readers along with me.	(ME interview)
There was an even greater disciplinary imbalance with the use of questions, which 
were almost exclusively confined to the soft fields. Here they served to structure 
the text and rhetorically position of readers by responding to a question imme-
diately, simultaneously initiating a dialogue to engage readers and closing it to 
present a claim:

	 (23)	 Does the Brain-in-a-vat thereby succeed in including the relation in which it 
stands to its environment in the extension of its term ‘the delusive relation’? 
There are, I think, compelling reasons to say that it does not. (Phil)
	 (24)	 What do these two have in common, one might ask? The answer is that they 
share the same politics. (AL)
The fact that they reach out to readers was seen as a distraction by my science 
informants:
Questions are quite rare in my field I think. You might find them in textbooks I sup-
pose, but generally we don’t use them. They seem rather intrusive, don’t they? Too 
personal. We generally prefer not to be too intrusive. (ME interview)
I am looking for the results in a paper, and to see if the method was sound. I am look-
ing for relevance and that kind of dressing is irrelevant. People don’t ask questions as 
it would be seen as irrelevant. And condescending probably. (EE interview)
In contrast, the soft knowledge writers saw them as an important way of relating 
to readers:
In my field that’s all there are, questions. Putting the main issues in the form of ques-
tions is a way of presenting my argument clearly and showing them I am on the same 
wavelength as them. (Phil interview)
Often I structure the argument by putting the problems that they might ask. (Mkt 
interview)
Finally, directives were the only interactive feature which occurred more frequent-
ly in the science and engineering papers than those in the humanities and social 
sciences. Generally, explicit engagement is a feature of the soft disciplines, where 
writers are less able to rely on the explanatory value of accepted procedures, but 
directives are a potentially risky tactic as they instruct readers to act or see things 
in a certain way. As a result, most directives in the soft fields were textual, directing 
readers to a reference rather than informing them how they should interpret an 
argument. Two of my respondents noted this in their interviews:
I am very conscious of using words like ‘must’ and ‘consider’ and so on and use them 
for a purpose. I want to say ‘Right, stop here. This is important and I want you to 
take notice of it’. So I suppose I am trying to take control of the reader and getting 
them to see things my way. (Soc interview)
I am aware of the effect that an imperative can have so I tend to use the more gentle 
ones. I don’t want to bang them over the head with an argument I want them to re-
flect on what I’m saying. I use ‘consider’ and ‘let’s look at this’ rather than something 
stronger. (AL interview)

The more linear and problem-oriented approach to knowledge construction in the 
hard knowledge fields, on the other hand, allows arguments to be formulated in a 
highly standardised code. This helps explain why cognitive directives, potentially 
the most threatening type, were overwhelmingly predominant in the natural sci-
ence corpus. These explicitly position readers by leading them through an argu-
ment to the writer’s claims (25 / 26) or by emphasising what they should attend to 
in the argument (27 /28):
	 (25)	 Consider a sequence of batches in an optimal schedule. (EE)
	 (26)	 … a distinction must be made between cytogenetic and molecular 
resolution. (Bio)
	 (27)	 What has to be recognised is that these issues … (ME)
	 (28)	 It is important to remember that primary electrons induce x rays. (Phy)
This facilitates succinctness and an economy of expression highly valued by space-
conscious editors and information-saturated scientists as several informants not-
ed:
I rarely give a lot of attention to the dressing, I look for the meat–the findings — and 
if the argument is sound. If someone wants to save me time in getting there then 
that is fine. No, I’m not worried about imperatives leading me through it.	 (EE in-
terview)
I’m very conscious of how I write and I am happy to use an imperative if it puts my 
idea over clearly. Often we are trying to work to word limits anyway, squeezing fairly 
complex arguments into a tight space. (ME interview)
10.	 Conclusions
I have argued that all writing has ‘voice’ and that it is an integral aspect of self-
representation in academic discourse. While we can still make decisions about 
our authoritativeness and presence, the kinds of people we can be in academic 
writing are very much framed by the options our disciplines make available for 
author intrusion and reader involvement. The notions of stance and engagement 
I have suggested here are an attempt to model how writers convey such a voice: 
the ways they deploy community-sensitive linguistic resources to represent them-
selves, their positions and their readers. Taken together, these different features are 
important ways of situating academic arguments in disciplinary communities and 
of enabling us to present ourselves as competent engineers, sociologists, linguists 
or whatever.

In other words, by making reference to the writer or the reader, we send a 
clear signal of membership. Our voice textually constructs both the writer and 
the reader as people with similar understandings and goals. This not only helps 
writers persuade their colleagues of their claims, but it also helps us to understand 
something about disciplinary communities and the ways they construct knowl-
edge. These different features, taken together, are important ways of situating ac-
ademic arguments in the interactions of members of disciplinary communities. 
They represent relatively conventional ways of making meaning and so elucidate 
a context for interpretation, showing how writers and readers make connections, 
through texts, to their disciplinary cultures.
