This paper reports on a literature review of theoretical and empirical research related to authorial voice in 
writing, spanning a period of over 50 years, from 1968 till 2021. The concepts of identity and voice in writing are 
often used interchangeably; however, some researchers differentiate the two conceptions, determining authorial 
voice as the writer’s identity reflected in writing. Over the span of the past 50 years the construct of authorial 
voice has undergone a shift from individual to social to a more recent eclectic or ‘dialogic’ conception of voice. 
The paper concludes with an outline of a path for further research on authorial voice in writing.   
1. Introduction 
The writers’ ability to use their voice effectively cannot be over­
estimated. However, the concept of voice in writing has been seen as 
complex and ill-defined (Atkinson, 2001; Guinda & Hyland, 2012; 
Hyland, 2012; Matsuda, 2015; Matsuda & Tardy, 2007; Tardy & Mat­
suda, 2009). Multiple definitions of voice have been suggested and the 
complexity of this notion has been related to the marginalisation of 
authorial voice in writing instruction since it is often seen as exceedingly 
challenging (Helms-Park & Stapleton, 2003; Stapleton, 2002). However, 
more recent studies have demonstrated a correlation between writing 
quality and authorial voice. 
In order to address the issue of relegation of authorial voice in 
writing instruction and to inform pedagogical practices related to voice 
in writing, it is essential to understand what authorial voice is. To 
achieve this purpose, this review adopts an exploratory framework and 
focuses on the following research question: 
How is authorial voice conceptualised in the research literature? 
The review includes research published between 1968 and 2021, as 
the earliest publication located in the course of the literature search was 
the study conducted by Elbow in 1968. 
2.1. Voice and identity in writing 
This literature review revealed that the concepts of voice and iden­
tity are closely related and are used interchangeably in the two literature 
reviews by Sperling and Appleman (2011) and Stock and Eik-Nes 
(2016), a theoretical publication by Schwartz, Luyckx, and Vignoles 
(2011), as well as in a number of empirical studies by Ivaniˇc and Camps 
(2001), Hirvela and Belcher (2001), Hanauer (2015), Bondi (2012), 
Thompson (2012), Hewings (2012), Santos and Da Silva (2016), Xu and 
Hu (2020) and Zhao (2013) (See the sections ‘Voice and identity used 
interchangeably’ in Tables 1 and 2). 
However, some researchers try to separate and differentiate between 
the notions of writer’s identity and voice in writing (See section 
‘Defining voice’ in Tables 1 and 2). For example, in her book published 
back in 1998, Rose Ivaniˇc proposes that identity in writing has four 
dimensions: ‘autobiographical self’, ‘possibilities for self-hood’, ‘dis­
coursal self’, and ‘self as author’ (Ivaniˇc, 1998, p. 23). However, it is the 
‘discoursal self’ or ‘discoursal repertoires which writers bring to the act 
of writing’ that Ivaniˇc (1998) identifies as ‘voice’ (p.22) or the impres­
sion created of the author through the features of written discourse. 
Matsuda (2015) in his theoretical article on identity in written 
discourse also differentiates the notions of voice and identity in writing, 
referring to Ivaniˇc’s fourth dimension of identity, self as author, or how 
writers claim authority and establish their authorial presence, as being 
central to the notion of voice (Ivaniˇc, 1998; Matsuda, 2015). 
In addition, Matsuda (2015), points out that ‘it is important to 
distinguish between the identity positions of the writer that are external 
to discourse, such as the demographic information, and identity as 
constructed and negotiated through discourse, which is captured by the 
concept … of … voice’ and is facilitated ‘by written discourse’ (p.141). 
Thus, both Ivaniˇc (1998) and Matsuda (2015) propose that identity in 
writing is a broader conception which encapsulates authorial voice as 
discoursal realisations of writer’s identity. 
In the empirical studies by Matsuda and Jeffery (2012) and Tardy 
(2012, pp. 34–48) the conceptions of voice and identity are also 
distinguished. Matsuda and Jeffery (2012) see voice as an aspect of

identity as they argue that ‘voice in written language [is] a metaphorical 
concept capturing the sense of identity that comes through when readers 
interact with texts” (p. 151). Tardy (2012, pp. 34–48) mentions an 
‘extra-textual identity’ (p.68), which is echoed in a recent empirical 
study by Zhao (2019) drawing a dividing line between authorial identity 
and authorial voice. Zhao (2019) suggests that the writer’s identity in­
cludes extra-textual features such as age, gender, and cultural back­
ground. Those extra-textual features, according to the analysis of 200 
argumentative essays by Chinese-speaking participants, have very 
limited impact on the authorial voice in participants’ writing. Thus, 
Zhao’s (2019) study shows authorial voice as pertaining to text. In 
contrast, authorial identity is seen as a broader notion that may include 
extra-textual demographical features, not necessarily reflected in the 
text. 
2.2. Theoretical research on voice in writing 
The review revealed that some literature takes a historical view of 
identity and voice (See Table 1). As Benwell and Stokoe (2006) point out 
in their book ‘Identity and Discourse’, a diachronic view of identity 
shows that it has been perceived differently in different periods of time, 
which usually reflects the dominant schools of thought in a certain 
period. That is, starting from the early modern period, identity had been 
treated as ‘a self-fashioning, agentive, internal project of the self’ 
(Benwell & Stokoe, 2006, p. 17). Later, it was understood as ‘social and

View of voice in writing 
Defining voice 
Guinda and Hyland 
(2012) 
defining voice as ‘[a] cumulative process … that exert an 
effect on the reader, for whom … [it is] … brought into 
existence, …; the realisation of … voice reveals the 
diversity and vibrancy shaped by conformity to 
community conventions and the expression of personal 
proclivities … because … Individual preferences [are] 
accountable to disciplinary practices’ (p. 9) 
Ivaniˇc (1998) 
differentiating between voice and identity, i.e., identity 
in writing has four dimensions: ‘autobiographical self’, 
‘possibilities for self-hood’, ‘discoursal self’, and ‘self as 
author’ (p. 23), while voice in writing is reflected in the 
discoursal self or ‘discoursal repertoires which writers 
bring to the act of writing’ (p. 22) 
Matsuda (2015) 
differentiating between voice and identity, i.e., the 
identity positions of the writer that are external to 
discourse, such as the demographic information, and 
identity as constructed and negotiated through discourse, 
which is captured by the concept … of … voice’ and is 
facilitated ‘by written discourse’ (p. 141) 
Bakhtin (1981) 
introducing voice as a social and historical concept: a 
dialogic view of author’s language in general, e.g., ‘every 
utterance’ being in part the language of an individual 
(participating in the centripetal forces of discourse, and 
in part belonging to ‘social and historical heteroglossia’ 
or multi-voicedness or ‘the centrifugal, stratifying forces’ 
of discourse (p. 272) 
Benwell and Stokoe 
(2006) 
adding to the definition of voice: a diachronic view of 
identity [and together with voice as an integral part of 
identity]: from the early modern period identity had 
been treated as ‘a self-fashioning, agentive, internal 
project of the self’ (p. 17); later, it was understood as 
‘social and collective’; in the post-structuralist age, 
challenging the limitations of the binary vision of the 
world, identity is perceived not as either individual or 
social but rather as ‘fluid, fragmentary, contingent’ (p. 
17). 
Devlin, K. (2016) 
adding to the definition of voice: a dialogic view of voice 
where the conflict between the individual authorial voice 
and the academic conventions ‘strangl[ing] individual 
voice’ is brought to the fore. (p. 34) 
Prior (2001) 
defining voice in writing as a dialogic construct that 
encapsulates both individual and social perspectives 
Voice and identity are used interchangeably 
Sperling and Appleman 
(2011) 
voice and identity are used interchangeably, e.g., 
‘Although individuals’ linguistic accomplishments many 
much clearer to identify than their identity achievements 
…, nevertheless, the phrase finding one’s voice implies this 
accomplishment.’ (p. 71) 
Stock and Eik-Nes 
(2016) 
voice and identity are used interchangeably (e.g., ‘Within 
the transformative approach of academic literacies 
research it is not enough to analyse and identify voice 
features in a text; it is also necessary to conduct 
interviews and talk about texts which highlight the 
context, discussing “the struggles to sustain identity as 
writers while accommodating the demands of the 
university” (Le Ha, 2009, p. 134). These studies often aim 
to raise critical awareness and help learners to take 
control over their writing and their voice … ’ (p.97)) 
Schwartz et al. (2011) 
voice and identity are used interchangeably, e.g., ‘Within 
this framework [CDA], identities are typically explored 
as power spaces in which the articulation of voice is 
“repressed”’ (p. 8), or ‘ … narrative identity [is] … a 
polyphonic novel within which different voices of self- 
express themselves in their unique and self-defining 
ways’ (p. 102) 
Individual view of voice 
Bowden (1999) 
problematising the individualistic assumption in the 
notion of voice as practised in writing textbooks and 
instructional practices 
Elbow (1968) 
voice in writing is distinct, strong and sincere, likened to 
the sound of physical voice 
Elbow (1994) 
voice in writing is recognisable, distinct, resonant and 
likened to the sound of physical voice

practices’ (p. 9) 
Ivaniˇc (1998) 
voice in writing is the discoursal self or ‘discoursal 
repertoires which writers bring to the act of writing’ (p. 
22) or the impression created of the author through the 
features of written discourse 
Dialogic view of voice 
Bakhtin (1981)

collective’. In the post-structuralist age, challenging the limitations of 
the binary vision of the world, identity is perceived not as either indi­
vidual or social but rather as ‘fluid, fragmentary, contingent’ (Benwell & 
Stokoe, 2006, p. 17). Being an integral part of identity, the notion of 
authorial voice has changed in line with the notion of identity, 
demonstrating the shift from individual to social to the eclectic combi­
nation of the individual and social aspects in their dialogic interaction 
with each other. 
2.2.1. Individual characteristics of voice 
The individual view of voice closely ties voice in writing to the 
spoken human voice in a sense that everyone’s voice in both speech and 
writing is unique, distinct and identifiable. A number of the empirical 
and theoretical studies published between 1968 and 1999, for example, 
Elbow (1968, 1994), Ford (1991), Ramanathan and Atkinson (1999) and 
Stewart (1969, 1992) as well as in few later studies reporting on the 
student and teacher perspectives (Jeffery, 2010; Petriˇc, 2010) see voice

through this individualistic lens as they discuss and assess voice in terms 
of how stylistically recognisable it is, as well as in terms of its presence or 
absence, authenticity and sincerity (See section ‘Individual view of 
voice’ in Table 1). 
Indeed, the earlier definitions of voice in writing that emphasise 
individual voice often establish close connections between metaphorical 
written voice and the human voice as vocalisation. Similar to seeing the 
notion of voice as individual vocalisation, Elbow (2007) argues that 
writers may develop a written voice that is unique, stylistically recog­
nisable and authentic. In the same vein, exemplifying the use of voice as 
an individual stamp, Stewart (1972), refers to an authentic authorial 
voice that sets a student apart from others despite the common experi­
ences the writers may share. 
Two of the studies conducted in 2010 indicate that the writers and 
writing instructors perceive authorial voice as a reflection of the au­
thor’s individuality in writing. More specifically, Jeffery’s (2010) study, 
conducted in a secondary school setting, showed that most of her 20 
teacher participants defined voice from an individual expressivist 
perspective, seeing voice as authorial presence, authenticity and 
expending the metaphorical view of voice as vocalisation to an abstract 
notion of voice as ‘the author’s soul ’ (p.101). 
In line with Jeffery’s (2010) study providing some insight into how 
teachers may understand voice, Petriˇc’s (2010) research demonstrates 
that students emphasise the individual qualities of voice as well. Inter­
viewing 30 master’s degree students about their understanding of voice 
in relation to their dissertation writing, she found that most of their 
definitions fell under the category of individual personal voice as many 
students equated voice with ownership, authority or opinion. 
2.2.2. Social characteristics of voice 
A number of publications in the late 1990s problematised the indi­
vidualistic assumption in the notion of voice as presented in writing 
textbooks and instructional practices (Bowden, 1999; Harris, 1997; 
Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999; Ramanathan & Kaplan, 1996) (See 
section ‘Social view of voice’ in Table 1). 
Ramanathan and Kaplan (1996), for example, associated the notion 
of voice with the ideology of Western individualism, pointing out that 
the concept of individual voice, prevailing in North American compo­
sition classrooms, is hard for both ESL and non-ESL students to grasp. 
Later, Hyland (2002, 2008) pointed out the importance of social context 
in constructing voice as writers choose specific discourses and align their 
work with particular texts and authors when constructing authorial 
voice. In particular, Hyland (2002) shows that writers within a discourse 
community often use similar ways to project their authorial voice. In this 
corpus-based discourse analysis, he explores the use of directives in 
undergraduate L2 writers and published academic authors and draws a 
conclusion that both experienced and novice writers are driven by the 
scope of the social and disciplinary conventions. In the same vein, 
Gea-Valor (2010) exploring voice through various linguistic features in 
book reviews, suggests that an author’s apparent textual voice is not 
independent of social aspects of writing, such as genre and audience, but 
rather is tied to those aspects in crucial ways. 
2.2.3. Dialogic characteristics of voice 
Two theoretical publications by Matsuda (2015) and Tardy (2012, 
pp. 34–48) point out that various conceptions of voice exist on the 
individual-social continuum (See section ‘Dialogic view of voice’ in 
Table 1). On the one end of this continuum, there is a personal orien­
tation or traditional conception of voice that sees voice as an expression 
of unique individuality. On the other end of the continuum, there is a 
socio-constructionist orientation, which may or may not acknowledge 
the possibility or desirability of individual voice but focuses more on the 
adoption of socially accepted and frequently occurring features within 
genres, disciplines and discourses. Occupying the space between these 
two 
extreme 
positions 
is 
another 
conception 
of 
voice: 
a 
socio-constructivist or dialogic view (Matsuda, 2015; Tardy, 2012, pp. 
34–48). In particular, Matsuda (2001, 2015) and Prior (2001) point out 
that this dialogic view of voice draws its inspiration from the sociocul­
tural vision of language expressed in the works of Bakhtin (1981) and 
accounts for both the individual and social nature of voice, recognising 
how individuality and social conventions are interdependent. 
To shed light on the dialogic conception of voice, this literature re­
view takes a closer look at the idea of the mutual coexistence and dia­
logic interaction between individual and social aspects of language that 
inspired this eclectic view of authorial voice. More specifically, this 
dialogic view of language is emphasised in Bakhtin’s (1981) work 
‘Dialogic Imagination’. In his collection of essays, Bakhtin (1981) talks 
about ‘every utterance’ being in part the language of an individual 
(participating in the centripetal forces of discourse) and in part 
belonging to ‘social and historical heteroglossia’ or multi-voicedness 
(‘the centrifugal, stratifying forces’ of discourse) (p.272). Bakhtin’s 
analogy between the dialogic relationships of individual and social in 
language and the centripetal and centrifugal forces in physics also sug­
gests the unavoidable confrontation between the oppositely directed 
vectors, which ultimately keep the system of discourse and, more 
broadly, the system of language in balance. Indeed, Bakhtin’s (1981) 
view of dialogue is rather broad and all-inclusive as it also comprises the 
interaction between the individual writer and the audience, which re­
sults in co-construction of voice and involves the impression the text 
leaves on the reader. In the same vein, Tardy (2012, pp. 34–48) warns 
that if the writer’s predictions about the reader do not coincide with the 
discourses that readers bring to a text, a writer’s voice may ‘misalign 
with the identit[y] … assigned by readers’ (p.40). 
Matsuda (2001) also sees voice in terms of its effect on the reader. He 
describes voice as ‘the amalgamative effect of the use of’ language fea­
tures that authors ‘choose from socially available yet ever-changing 
repertoires’ (Matsuda, 2001, p. 41). However, even more importantly, 
Matsuda’s definition offers a solution to the ‘false dichotomy’ (Tardy, 
2012, p. 39) of individual versus social, accounting for both individual 
and social aspects of voice mediated by written discourse in its dynamic 
contexts. 
2.3. Empirical research on voice in writing 
2.3.1. Focus on individual voice 
The bulk of empirical studies that emphasised the importance of 
individual aspects of voice date back to the 1970–1990s (for example, 
Aghbar & Chitrapu, 1997; Blair, 1991; Hamalian, 1970; Murphy, 1991; 
Ritchie, 1989; Stewart, 1992; Strange & Alston, 1998). Although these 
studies vary in their participants and settings, they are similar in their 
strong advocacy for teaching students how to project their individual 
voices (See section’ Individual view of voice’ in Table 2). 
In the tertiary setting, for example, Stewart (1992) strongly advo­
cates for an authentic and unique voice to be taught in composition 
classes for university students. He likens a writer’s voice without in­
dividuality to Brahm’s Violin Concerto in D Major without ‘the essential 
passion and fire … which are the fundamental essence of the piece’s 
greatness’ (p.280). He even extends the metaphor to compare the 
composition of a text without the uniqueness of individual voice to the 
construction of a human being unable to breathe and essentially losing 
its human qualities. After the analysis of the works of a number of ex­
perts in composition teaching and some professional writers, Stewart 
(1992) concludes that ‘any good writer has a single identifiable voice’ 
(p.288) and warns the reader about the dangers of writing without in­
dividual personality and experience as potentially leading to all the evils 
of modern society, which is already too materialistic and essentially 
soulless. 
In the high school setting, Hamalian (1970) and Murphy (1991) 
share the results of their intervention programs for L1 high school 
writers, emphasising the importance of an original and sincere voice in 
writing. Hamalian (1970) starts his paper by saying that ‘[m]uch bad 
prose written by students sounds as though it had been ground out by a 
O. Mhilli

sausage machine or produced with labour pains’ (p.227). Through this 
utilisation of vivid imagery in his opening statement, Hamalian (1970) 
not only projects his individuality but also reinforces his argument in 
favour of a unique personal voice. Then, after looking at the experi­
mental projects such as The Voice Project at Stanford University as well 
as his own teaching experience, he highlights the different ways of 
projecting individual voice and even suggests that elements of creative 
writing can be fed into expository writing in order to make it more 
original, unconventional and closer to common speech. ‘[O]nly in his [or 
her] own unique, personal, individual voice’, Hamalian (1970) con­
cludes, ‘unrestrained and uninhibited can … [the writer] communicate 
to us the experience of being alive … ’ (p.230). Murphy (1991), 
reporting on the results of her intervention program aimed to invoke 
spark and personality in her composition students’ voices, provides a list 
of techniques for finding individual voice in writing. Among other rec­
ommendations, these techniques include a reminder that voice in 
writing has a connection to the spoken voice and should be clear and 
sincere. 
Another study conducted in the high school setting by Blair in 1991 
deals with ESL writers underlined the importance of sincere individual 
voice in writing. Blair (1991) analyses narrative voices of immigrant 
children in her English composition classes in a secondary school in the 
US. She looks at how the incorporation of the immigrant literature as a 
stimulus for the ESL students helped her invoke ‘private’ ‘intimate’ 
voices, which are more common for writing in L1 rather than in L2. 
These ‘strong, honest voices’ Blair aims to bring forward in her ESL 
students ‘emanate from their knowledge and perspectives on life’ (Blair, 
1991, pp. 24, 25). By providing an example of one of her students dis­
playing powerful individuality and authority in her voice, Blair cele­
brates her pedagogical success in creating the conditions where her 
students’ individual voices are clearly heard in their compositions. 
It should be noted that most of the studies focused on the individual 
perception of voice, were conducted in English composition classes 
where participants composed mostly narrative prose, a genre stimu­
lating the projection of unique individuality on the part of the writer. In 
fact, focused on individual characteristics of voice and being mostly 
intervention action research studies aimed at addressing immediate 
problems in composition classrooms, these studies do not apply any 
concrete analytical frameworks for voice analysis, relying on a very 
intuitive perception of voice. 
2.3.2. Focus on social voice 
The social and discoursal realisations of voice are brought to the fore 
mainly by means of the analysis of the conventions of disciplines, cul­
tures and genres within which the texts are created (See section ‘Social 
view of voice’ in Table 2). A number of empirical studies have explored 
voice to investigate variations related to the social and cultural context, 
for instance, how the disciplinary field or the genre have impacted the 
writer’s voice (for example, Bondi, 2012; Breivega et al., 2002; Gross & 
Chesley, 2012; Hyland, 2008; Hyland, 2012; Fløttum, 2010; Fløttum, 
2012; Kuhi & Behnam, 2011; Lor´es-Sanz, 2011; Pho, 2008; Stotesbury, 
2006; Silver, 2012). Studies by Breivega et al., in 2002 and then Fløttum 
in 2010 and 2012, comparing scientific articles in different languages 
and different disciplines, concluded that the impact of the discipline on 
the writer’s voice is greater than the impact of the first language. 
Another study examining the variations of different ‘disciplinary voices’ 
was conducted by Hyland (2008), who compared specific interpersonal 
features that construct authorial voice in research articles in different 
disciplines. Using his interactional model as an analytical tool, he found 
more stance markers in the soft than in hard disciplines and explained 
that this was due to the different disciplinary communities’ ways of 
knowledge construction. 
Other studies of variations of authorial voice in different disciplines 
have focused on specific parts of research articles. Both Pho (2008) and 
Stotesbury (2006), for instance, focused on abstracts of research articles. 
Pho (2008) compared abstracts in the fields of applied linguistics and 
educational technology and showed similarities regarding various lin­
guistic features of authorial voice in one discipline. Stotesbury (2006), in 
turn, studied the abstracts in the subfields within economic sciences and 
found a more impersonal stance in the abstracts in humanities than in 
natural sciences. In the same vein, Silver’s (2012) analysis of in­
troductions from microbiology, history of science and art history 
showed significant variations in the ways the writers construct their 
voice. Silver (2012) identified two main voices as ‘paradigmatic’ or 
conceptualising voice and ‘narrative’ voice (p. 203). The paradigmatic 
voice was the most common in introductions from microbiology where 
the authors were more objective and empirical. In contrast, the anec­
dotal narrative voice was found in introductions from the history of 
science and art history where the writers were more inclined to engage 
the reader and experiment with their authorial voice to achieve a 
rhetorical purpose. 
When studying authorial voice within one discipline, cultural dif­
ferences seem to come to the fore. For instance, Lor´es-Sanz (2011) 
examined ‘the interplay of cultural and disciplinary factors’ (p. 173) in 
research articles within the discipline of business management, written 
by L1 and L2 writers in English and Spanish. Focusing on the use of 
first-person pronouns, she found most author visibility in the English 
texts written by L1 writers and least in the Spanish texts written by 
Spanish writers. 
A cultural impact from a different angle was shown in Gross and 
Chesley’s (2012) study. They showed how contextual aspects such as 
industrial funding might influence the writer’s voice. Analysing the use 
of hedges in research articles, they found that researchers presented 
their results ‘in a way that encourages readers to give more credence to 
their claims than their evidential base permits’ (Gross & Chesley, 2012, 
p. 90), and they found fewer hedges in articles with industrial funding 
than in those without. 
Genre, being an essentially socially conditioned way of communi­
cation, also has an impact on the writer’s voice. For example, Bondi’s 
(2012) comparison of academic textbooks and journal articles revealed 
that evaluative language and the voice of the ‘Academic Arguer’ is more 
prominent in journal articles whereas the voice of the ‘Recounter’ and 
‘Interpreter’ is more prominent in textbooks. 
The most recent studies that focused on the contexts of authorial 
voice, while differing greatly in the scope, methodology and aims, 
highlight similar issues related to the topic of authorial voice in aca­
demic discourse and come to very similar conclusions regarding the 
importance of rhetorical conventions of the disciplines and genres for 
students’ authorial voice. For instance, O’Hallaron and Schleppegrell 
(2016) and Ramoroka (2017) point out that there is little consensus 
among writing instructors about what authorial voice is and what lin­
guistic choices student writers should make in order to project their 
voices more effectively. Another concern expressed in most recent 
studies is related to the vulnerability of the individual voice of an author 
when confronted with the conventions of the genres they compose (de 
Magalh˜aes et al., 2019; O’Hallaron & Schleppegrell, 2016; Ramoroka, 
2017). DeMagalhes et al. (2019), O’Hallaron and Schleppegrell (2016) 
and Ramoroka (2017) concur when it comes to the discussion of the 
implications for the teaching of authorial voice, pointing out that it is 
essential to make ESL students aware of the importance of authorial 
voice in academic writing and the language features that help project 
voice. They also indicate the importance of teaching authorial voice 
explicitly, bringing to the fore specific requirement and expectations of 
the disciplines and genres the students write within. 
2.3.3. Focus on dialogic voice 
The significance of empirical studies that take a dialogic perspective 
on voice cannot be overestimated because they reflect the most recent 
eclectic view of authorial voice through both individual and social 
lenses. In these studies, equal importance is attached to the individual 
and social aspects of voice perpetually co-existing in any text while at 
the same time being in constant confrontation with one another (See 
O. Mhilli

section ‘Dialogic view of voice’ in Table 2). 
For instance, challenging the conventions of ‘the monolithic essay’, 
Devlin (2016) compares the academic style guidelines with the actual 
work produced by academics, drawing attention to the significant dis­
crepancies between the two. While describing a standardised academic 
essay as a ‘dry’, ‘flat’, ‘formulaic’, ‘fossilised’, ‘turgid and dull’, 
‘lamentable restriction’, ‘clogged with nominalisations’, she argues that 
in the times of digital literacies, when information is passed on via a 
variety of modes and in an increasing number of unconventional ways. 
As a result, the individual voice of a writer is essentially at war with the 
postulated genre of an academic essay. Elaborating on the metaphor of 
war, Devlin (2016) talks about academic writing conventions ‘killing the 
pronouns’ and ‘strangl[ing] the individual authorial voice’ (pp.34-37). 
In the same vein, two recent empirical studies by Fallas Escobar and 
Chaves Fern´andez (2017) and Santos and Da Silva (2016) deal with the 
challenges strong authorial voices come across when trying to be heard 
within the conventions of their disciplines and prescriptive genres. 
Fallas Escobar and Chaves Fern´andez (2017) found that although some 
ESL students in university composition courses in a Costa-Rican uni­
versity have positive attitudes toward the inclusion of boosters/hedges 
and stance-taking strategies, they showed a certain resistance to the 
inclusion of these voice-related language features in their essays. This 
finding was illuminated by their opinions and perceptions that the use of 
lexical bundles, in particular, obscured their voice and felt alien to them. 
Some students altogether failed to see how some linguistic and rhetor­
ical devices could translate into the development of their own voice. The 
findings indicate the difficulty the writers encounter when trying to find 
the middle ground between the common discoursal features of academic 
writing and their desire to project their own voice. All in all, Fallas 
Escobar and Chaves Fern´andez (2017) conclude their study with a 
warning that ‘the composition class can become a space where attempts 
at nurturing students’ voice can actually threaten, suffocate or suppress 
it’ as the students are exclusively taught the genre conventions or ‘the 
contextually valued ways of academic writing’ (p.121). 
The problem with projecting your personal individual voice in aca­
demic writing seems to become even more urgent when it comes to more 
mature and experienced ESL writers as is shown in the study by Santos 
and Da Silva (2016). Their study of abstracts by Portuguese linguists 
traced a gradual disappearance of individual features of authorial voice, 
such as frequent use of self-mention, over a period from 2001 till 2010, 
as the Portuguese researchers were trying to comply with the norms of 
academic writing in English. Santos and Da Silva (2016) conclude their 
study by saying that the writers are torn between the standards of aca­
demic writing in English and their individual voice in Portuguese. 
Rather than focusing on either individual or social characteristics of 
voice, the above-mentioned studies deal with the dialogic interplay and 
even a rather confrontational dialogue between individual aspects of 
authorial voice within sociocultural contexts of academic writing. 
3. Discussion 
This configurative review aimed to provide insights into authorial 
voice in writing as a concept in the research literature. The review 
revealed that in the literature on voice in writing the notions of writer’s 
identity and writer’s voice are often used interchangeably. Thus, in 
order to provide a clear definition of authorial voice, it was necessary 
first to differentiate the notions of voice and identity in writing. In fact, 
the review revealed some studies that indicated the difference between 
the two notions. Drawing on Matsuda’s (2001, 2015) explanation of 
voice in writing, this literature review concludes that authorial voice is 
the identity of the author reflected in written discourse, where written 
discourse should be understood as an ever evolving and dynamic source 
of language features available to the writer to choose from to express 
their voice. To clarify further, authorial identity may encapsulate such 
extra-discoursal features as race, national origin, age, or gender. 
Authorial voice, in contrast, comprises, only those aspects of identity 
that can be traced in a piece of writing. Not only does this definition 
solve the issue of the confusion between the notions of the writer’s voice 
and identity by separating the two concepts, but it also solves the false 
dilemma of the binary, either individual or social, view of authorial 
voice revealed by the literature review. Indeed, the definition in­
corporates both individual and social dimensions, encapsulating the 
context-dependent and changeable nature of individual voice in writing. 
This review also revealed that the most recent empirical studies bring 
to the fore the dialogic interaction between the unique personal voice 
and the restrictions social or discoursal conventions, especially the 
conventions of academic writing, place on the expression of authorial 
individuality. 
It is hoped that more empirical studies on voice in writing will take 
the dialogic perspective and look at authorial voice via this non-binary 
eclectic lens. In particular, research taking the dialogic perspective on 
voice is crucial in the academic writing settings as it is in this context 
that the tension between the individual uniqueness of the writer’s voice 
and the limiting discoursal conventions appears. 
4. Limitations 
This review is limited in several respects. First, despite the limitation 
of looking at the research published only in English, the review looked at 
the studies conducted in different countries. Second, the sample of this 
review is void of grey literature (e.g., working papers) and includes only 
published work. Despite the fact that this inclusion criterion decreased 
the sample size, it arguably improved the quality of literature included 
in the review. Third, the review looked at the literature on authorial 
voice in writing without discriminating according to gender, linguistic 
or cultural background of the participants or their age with the purpose 
of gaining a broader understanding of the concept of voice in writing. 
The review looked at the studies conducted in various contexts, from 
high school to thesis and scholarly publications as in this review the 
development of authorial writing is seen as a continuum across various 
settings starting from high school and going all the way to doctoral 
writing. A more discriminatory approach may shed more light on the 
differences between the research focused on writers of different gender, 
first language, country of origin, age or more specific context of writing 
in academic settings.
