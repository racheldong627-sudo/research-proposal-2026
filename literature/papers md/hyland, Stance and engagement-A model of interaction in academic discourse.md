A B S T R AC T A great deal of research has now established that written texts
embody interactions between writers and readers. A range of linguistic
features have been identiﬁed as contributing to the writer’s projection of a
stance to the material referenced by the text, and, to a lesser extent, the
strategies employed to presuppose the active role of an addressee. As yet,
however, there is no overall typology of the resources writers employ to express
their positions and connect with readers. Based on an analysis of 240
published research articles from eight disciplines and insider informant
interviews, I attempt to address this gap and consolidate much of my earlier
work to offer a framework for analysing the linguistic resources of inter-
subjective positioning. Attending to both stance and engagement, the model
provides a comprehensive and integrated way of examining the means by
which interaction is achieved in academic argument and how the discoursal
preferences of disciplinary communities construct both writers and readers.

Stance and engagement: a model of interaction in 
academic discourse
Over the past decade or so, academic writing has gradually lost its traditional tag
as an objective, faceless and impersonal form of discourse and come to be seen as
a persuasive endeavour involving interaction between writers and readers. This
view sees academics as not simply producing texts that plausibly represent an
external reality, but also as using language to acknowledge, construct and nego-
tiate social relations. Writers seek to offer a credible representation of themselves
and their work by claiming solidarity with readers, evaluating their material and
acknowledging alternative views, so that controlling the level of personality in a
text becomes central to building a convincing argument. Put succinctly, every

successful academic text displays the writer’s awareness of both its readers and
its consequences.
As this view gains greater currency, more researchers have turned their
attention to the concept of evaluation and how it is realized in academic texts.
Indeed, much of my own work over the past decade or so has been devoted to
this. Consequently, a variety of linguistic resources such as hedges, reporting
verbs, that-constructions, questions, personal pronouns, and directives have
been examined for the role they play in this persuasive endeavour (e.g. Hyland,
2000; Hyland and Tse, forthcoming; Swales, 1990; Thompson, 2001). Despite
this plethora of research, however, we do not yet have a model of interpersonal
discourse that unites and integrates these features and that emerges from the
study of academic writing itself. How do academic writers use language to
express a stance and relate to their readers? This is the question addressed in this
article, that brings together a diverse array of features by drawing on interviews
and a corpus of 240 research articles to offer a framework for understanding the
linguistic resources of academic interaction. My aim, then, is to consolidate my
previous work using this corpus to offer a model of stance and engagement in
academic texts.
Interaction and evaluation
Evaluation, as Bondi and Mauranen (2003) have recently observed, ‘is an elusive
concept’. For while we recognize interaction and evaluation in academic texts, it
is not always clear how they are achieved. The ways that writers and speakers
express their opinions have long been recognized as an important feature of
language, however, and research has attempted to account for these meanings in
a number of ways. Hunston and Thompson (2000) use the term ‘evaluation’ to
refer to the writer’s judgements, feelings, or viewpoint about something, and
others have described these varied linguistic resources as attitude (Halliday,
1994), epistemic modality (Hyland, 1998), appraisal (Martin, 2000; White,
2003), stance (Biber and Finegan, 1989; Hyland, 1999), and metadiscourse
(Crismore, 1989; Hyland and Tse, 2004).
Interest in the interpersonal dimension of writing has, in fact, always been
central to both systemic functional and social constructionist frameworks, which
share the view that all language use is related to speciﬁc social, cultural and 
institutional contexts. These approaches have sought to elaborate the ways 
linguistic features create this relationship as writers comment on their proposi-
tions and shape their texts to the expectations of their audiences. Perhaps the
most systematic approach to these issues to date has been the work on appraisal
which offers a typology of evaluative resources available in English (Martin,
2000). For Martin, appraisal largely concerns the speaker’s attitudinal positions,
distinguishing three sub-categories of affect, judgement, and appreciation,
roughly glossed as construing emotion, moral assessments, and aesthetic 
values respectively, and the ways these are graded for intensity. While this broad

characterization is interesting, however, it is unclear how far these resources are
actually employed in particular registers and to what extent they can be seen as
comprising core semantic features in given contexts of use.
Because the work on evaluation and stance is relatively new, much of it has
tended to concentrate on mass audience texts, such as journalism, politics, and
media discourses, which are likely to yield the richest crop of explicitly evaluative
examples. Yet these public genres tend to offer writers far more freedom to 
position themselves interpersonally than academic genres. Because we do not yet
have a model of evaluative discourse that emerges from the study of academic
writing itself, we cannot say which features are typical in scholarly writing,
rather than which are possible. It seems, for example, that ‘attitude’ in academic
texts more often concerns writers’ judgements of epistemic probability and 
estimations of value, with affective meanings less prominent (Hyland, 1999,
2000). The role of hedging and boosting, for instance, is well documented in 
academic prose as communicative strategies for conveying reliability and strate-
gically manipulating the strength of commitment to claims to achieve inter-
personal goals.
An important consideration here is that evaluation is always carried out in
relation to some standard. Personal judgements are only convincing, or even
meaningful, when they contribute to and connect with a communal ideology or
value system concerning what is taken to be normal, interesting, relevant, novel,
useful, good, bad, and so on. Academic writers’ use of evaluative resources is
inﬂuenced by different epistemological assumptions and permissible criteria of
justiﬁcation, and this points to and reinforces speciﬁc cultural and institutional
contexts. Writers’ evaluative choices, in other words, are not made from all the
alternatives the language makes available, but from a more restricted sub-set of
options which reveal how they understand their communities through the
assumptions these encode. Meanings are ultimately produced in the interaction
between writers and readers in speciﬁc social circumstances, which means that a
general categorization of interactional features is unable to show how academic
writers, through their disciplinary practices, construct and maintain relation-
ships with their readers and thus with their communities.
To be persuasive, writers need to connect with this value system, making
rhetorical choices which evaluate both their propositions, and their audience. In
sum, to understand what counts as effective persuasion in academic writing,
every instance of evaluation has to be seen as an act socially situated in a 
disciplinary or institutional context.
Stance and engagement
Interaction in academic writing essentially involves ‘positioning’, or adopting a
point of view in relation to both the issues discussed in the text and to others who
hold points of view on those issues. In claiming a right to be heard, and to have
their work taken seriously, writers must display a competence as disciplinary

insiders. This competence is, at least in part, achieved through a writer–reader
dialogue which situates both their research and themselves, establishing 
relationships between people, and between people and ideas. Successful aca-
demic writing thus depends on the individual writer’s projection of a shared 
professional context. That is, in pursuing their personal and disciplinary goals,
writers seek to create a recognizable social world through rhetorical choices
which allow them to conduct interpersonal negotiations and balance claims for
the signiﬁcance, originality and plausibility of their work against the convictions
and expectations of their readers.
The motivation for these writer–reader interactions lies in the fact that 
readers can always refute claims and this gives them an active and constitutive
role in how writers construct their arguments. Any successfully published
research paper anticipates a reader’s response and itself responds to a larger 
discourse already in progress. This locates the writer intertextually within a
larger web of opinions (Bakhtin, 1986), and within a community whose 
members are likely to recognize only certain forms of argument as valid and
effective. Results and interpretations need to be presented in ways that readers
are likely to ﬁnd persuasive, and so writers must draw on these to express their
positions, represent themselves, and engage their audiences.
Evaluation is therefore critical to academic writing as effective argument 
represents careful considerations of one’s colleagues as writers situate them-
selves and their work to reﬂect and shape a valued disciplinary ethos. These
interactions are managed by writers in two main ways.
1.
Stance. They express a textual ‘voice’ or community recognized personality
which, following others, I shall call stance. This can be seen as an attitudinal
dimension and includes features which refer to the ways writers present
themselves and convey their judgements, opinions, and commitments. It is
the ways that writers intrude to stamp their personal authority onto their
arguments or step back and disguise their involvement.
2.
Engagement. Writers relate to their readers with respect to the positions
advanced in the text, which I call engagement (Hyland, 2001). This is an
alignment dimension where writers acknowledge and connect to others, 
recognizing the presence of their readers, pulling them along with their argu-
ment, focusing their attention, acknowledging their uncertainties, including
them as discourse participants, and guiding them to interpretations.
The key resources by which these interactional macro-functions are realized are
summarized in Figure 1 and discussed in more detail below.
Together these resources have a dialogic purpose in that they refer to, antici-
pate, or otherwise take up the actual or anticipated voices and positions of poten-
tial readers (Bakhtin, 1986). Stance and engagement are two sides of the same
coin and, because they both contribute to the interpersonal dimension of
discourse, there are overlaps between them. Discrete categories inevitably con-
ceal the fact that forms often perform more than one function at once because, in

developing their arguments, writers are simultaneously trying to set out a claim,
comment on its truth, establish solidarity and represent their credibility. But it is
generally possible to identify predominant meanings to compare the rhetorical
patterns in different discourse communities.
It should also be borne in mind that evaluation is expressed in a wide range of
ways which makes a ﬁne-grained typology problematic. While writers can mark
their perspectives explicitly through lexical items (such as unfortunately, possible,
interesting, etc.), they can also code them less obviously through conjunction,
subordination, repetition, contrast, etc. (e.g. Hunston, 1994). Moreover, because
the marking of stance and engagement is a highly contextual matter, members
can employ evaluations through a shared attitude towards particular methods or
theoretical orientations which may be opaque to the analyst. Nor is it always
marked by words at all: a writer’s decision not to draw an obvious conclusion
from an argument, for example, may be read by peers as a signiﬁcant absence. It
may not always be possible therefore to recover the community understandings
and references embedded in more implicit realizations.
Distinguishing between these two dimensions is a useful starting point from
which to explore how interaction and persuasion are achieved in academic dis-
course and what these can tell us of the assumptions and practices of different
disciplines. This is what I set out to do below. Following a description of the
corpus, I sketch out some of the key resources of stance and engagement and 
discuss what these differences in functionality tell us about the epistemological
and social beliefs of disciplinary cultures.
Corpus and methods
My view of stance and engagement is based on a series of studies which draw on
both qualitative and quantitative approaches, comprising the analysis of a
corpus of published articles and interviews with academics. The text corpus con-
sists of 240 research articles comprising three papers from each of ten leading
journals in eight disciplines selected to represent a broad cross-section of

academic practice and facilitate access to informants. The ﬁelds were mechanical
engineering (ME), electrical engineering (EE), marketing (Mk), philosophy (Phil),
sociology (Soc), applied linguistics (AL), physics (Phy) and microbiology (Bio).
The value of exploring such a large corpus is that it makes available many
instances of the target features in a naturally occurring discourse, replicating the
language-using experience of community members.
The texts were converted to an electronic corpus of 1.4 million words and
searched for speciﬁc features seen as initiating writer–reader interactions using
WordPilot 2000, a text analysis and concordance programme. A list of 320
potentially productive search items was compiled based on previous research
into interactive features (e.g. Biber and Finegan, 1989; Bondi, 1999; Hyland,
1999, 2000), from grammars (Biber et al., 1999; Halliday, 1994), and from 
the most frequently occurring items in the articles themselves. All cases were
examined to ensure they functioned as interactional markers and a sample was
double-checked by a colleague working independently.
The interviews were conducted with experienced researcher/writers from the
target disciplines using a semi-structured format. These employed open-ended
interview prompts which focused on subjects’ own and others’ writing, but
allowed them to raise other relevant issues. Subjects could therefore respond to
texts with insider community understandings of rhetorical effectiveness, while
also discussing their own discoursal preferences and practices.
Stance and features of writer positioning
Stance concerns writer-oriented features of interaction and refers to the ways 
academics annotate their texts to comment on the possible accuracy or credibil-
ity of a claim, the extent they want to commit themselves to it, or the attitude
they want to convey to an entity, a proposition, or the reader. I take it to have
three main components: evidentiality, affect and presence. Evidentiality refers to
the writer’s expressed commitment to the reliability of the propositions he or she
presents and their potential impact on the reader; affect involves a broad range of
personal and professional attitudes towards what is said, including emotions,
perspectives and beliefs; and presence simply concerns the extent to which the
writer chooses to project him or herself into the text. It is comprised of four main
elements:
1.
Hedges.
2.
Boosters.
3.
Attitude markers.
4.
Self-mentions.
Hedges are devices like possible, might and perhaps, that indicate the writer’s 
decision to withhold complete commitment to a proposition, allowing informa-
tion to be presented as an opinion rather than accredited fact. Because all 
statements are evaluated and interpreted through a prism of disciplinary

assumptions, writers must calculate what weight to give to an assertion, attest-
ing to the degree of precision or reliability that they want it to carry and perhaps
claiming protection in the event of its eventual overthrow (Hyland, 1998).
Hedges, therefore, imply that a statement is based on plausible reasoning rather
than certain knowledge, indicating the degree of conﬁdence it is prudent to
attribute to it (Example 1):
(1) Our results suggest that rapid freeze and thaw rates during artiﬁcial experiments
in the laboratory may cause artifactual formation of embolism. Such experiments
may not quantitatively represent the amount of embolism that is formed during
winter freezing in nature. In the chaparral at least, low temperature episodes usually
result in gradual freeze-thaw events. 
(Bio)
Equally importantly, hedges also allow writers to open a discursive space where
readers can dispute their interpretations. Claim-making is risky because it can
contradict existing literature or challenge the research of one’s readers, which
means that arguments must accommodate readers’ expectations that they will
be allowed to participate in a dialogue and that their own views will be acknowl-
edged in the discourse. By marking statements as provisional, hedges seek 
to involve readers as participants in their ratiﬁcation, conveying deference, 
modesty, or respect for colleagues views (Hyland, 1998). Two of my informants
noted this:
Of course, I make decisions about the ﬁndings I have, but it is more convincing to tie
them closely to the results.
(Phy interview)
You have to relate what you say to your colleagues and we don’t encourage people to
go out and nail their colours to the mast as maybe they don’t get it published.
(Bio interview)
Boosters, on the other hand, are words like clearly, obviously and demonstrate,
which allow writers to express their certainty in what they say and to mark
involvement with the topic and solidarity with their audience. They function to
stress shared information, group membership, and engagement with readers
(Hyland, 1999). Like hedges, they often occur in clusters, underlining the
writer’s conviction in his or her argument (Example 2):
(2) This brings us into conﬂict with Currie’s account, for static images surely cannot 
trigger our capacity to recognize movement. If that were so, we would see the image
as itself moving. With a few interesting exceptions we obviously do not see a static
image as moving. Suppose, then, that we say that static images only depict instants.
This too creates problems, for it suggests that we have a recognitional capacity for
instants, and this seems highly dubious.
(Phil)
Boosters can therefore help writers to present their work with assurance while
effecting interpersonal solidarity, setting the caution and self-effacement 
suggested by hedges against assertion and involvement.

Both boosters and hedges represent a writer’s response to the potential view-
points of readers and an acknowledgement of disciplinary norms of appropriate
argument. They balance objective information, subjective evaluation and inter-
personal negotiation, and this can be a powerful factor in gaining acceptance for
claims. Both strategies emphasize that statements not only communicate ideas,
but also the writer’s attitude to them and to readers. Writers must weigh up the
commitment they want to invest in their arguments based on its epistemic status
and the effect this commitment might have on readers’ responses. These com-
ments from my interview data suggest the importance of getting this balance
right:
I’m very much aware that I’m building a façade of authority when I write, I really
like to get behind my work and get it out there. Strong. Committed. That’s the voice
I’m trying to promote, even when I’m uncertain I want to be behind what I say.
(Soc interview)
You have to be seen to believe what you say. That they are your arguments. It’s what
gives you credibility. It’s the whole point.
(Phil interview)
I like tough minded verbs like ‘think’. It’s important to show where you stand. The
people who are best known have staked out the extreme positions. The people who sit
in the middle and use words like ‘suggest’, no one knows their work.
(Soc interview)
Attitude markers indicate the writer’s affective, rather than epistemic, attitude to
propositions, conveying surprise, agreement, importance, frustration, and so on,
rather than commitment. While attitude is expressed throughout a text by 
the use of subordination, comparatives, progressive particles, punctuation, text
location, and so on, it is most explicitly signalled by attitude verbs (e.g. agree,
prefer), sentence adverbs (unfortunately, hopefully), and adjectives (appropriate, 
logical, remarkable). By signalling an assumption of shared attitudes, values and
reactions to material, writers both express a position and pull readers into a con-
spiracy of agreement so that it can often be difﬁcult to dispute these judgements
(Example 3):

Self-mention refers to the use of ﬁrst person pronouns and possessive adjectives to
present propositional, affective and interpersonal information (Hyland, 2001).
Presenting a discoursal self is central to the writing process (Ivanic, 1998), and
writers cannot avoid projecting an impression of themselves and how they stand
in relation to their arguments, their discipline, and their readers. The presence or
absence of explicit author reference is generally a conscious choice by writers to
adopt a particular stance and disciplinary-situated authorial identity. In the 
sciences it is common for writers to downplay their personal role to highlight the
phenomena under study, the replicability of research activities, and the general-
ity of the ﬁndings, subordinating their own voice to that of unmediated nature.
Such a strategy subtly conveys an empiricist ideology that suggests research 
outcomes would be the same irrespective of the individual conducting it. One of
my respondents expressed this view clearly:
I feel a paper is stronger if we are allowed to see what was done without ‘we did this’
and ‘we think that’. Of course we know there are researchers there, making inter-
pretations and so on, but this is just assumed. It’s part of the background. I’m look-
ing for something interesting in the study and it shouldn’t really matter who did
what in any case.
(Bio interview)
In the humanities and social sciences, in contrast, the use of the ﬁrst person is
closely related to the desire to both strongly identify oneself with a particular
argument and to gain credit for an individual perspective. Personal reference is a
clear indication of the perspective from which a statement should be interpreted,
enabling writers to emphasize their own contribution to the ﬁeld and to seek
agreement for it (Example 4):
(4) I argue that their treatment is superﬁcial because, despite appearances, it relies
solely on a sociological, as opposed to an ethical, orientation to develop a response.
(Soc)
I bring to bear on the problem my own experience. This experience contains ideas
derived from reading I have done which might be relevant to my puzzlement as well
as my personal contacts with teaching contexts.
(AL)
In these more discursive domains, then, self-mention clearly demarcates the
writer’s role in the research:
Using ‘I’ emphasizes what you have done. What is yours in any piece of research. I
notice it in papers and use it a lot myself.
(Soc interview)
The personal pronoun ‘I’ is very important in philosophy. It not only tells people that
it is your own unique point of view, but that you believe what you are saying. It
shows your colleagues where you stand in relation to the issues and in relation to
where they stand on them. It marks out the differences.

Engagement and features of reader positioning
In comparison with stance, the ways writers bring readers into the discourse to
anticipate their possible objections and engage them in appropriate ways have
been relatively neglected in the literature. Based on their previous experiences
with texts, writers make predictions about how readers are likely to react to their
arguments. They know what they are likely to ﬁnd persuasive, where they will
need help in interpreting the argument, what objections they are likely to raise,
and so on. This process of audience evaluation therefore assists writers in 
constructing an effective line of reasoning and, like stance options, also points to
the ways language is related to speciﬁc cultural and institutional contexts
(Hyland, 2001). There are two main purposes to writers’ uses of engagement
strategies:
1.
Acknowledgement of the need to adequately meet readers’ expectations of
inclusion and disciplinary solidarity. Here we ﬁnd readers addressed as 
participants in an argument with reader pronouns and interjections.
2.
To rhetorically position the audience. Here the writer pulls readers into the
discourse at critical points, predicting possible objections and guiding them
to particular interpretations with questions, directives and references to
shared knowledge.
Again, these two functions are not always clearly distinguishable, as writers
invariably use language to solicit reader collusion on more than one front simul-
taneously. They do, however, help us to see some of the ways writers project read-
ers into texts and how this is done in different disciplines. There are ﬁve main
elements to engagement:
1.
Reader pronouns.
2.
Personal asides.
3.
Appeals to shared knowledge.
4.
Directives.
5.
Questions.
Reader pronouns are perhaps the most explicit way that readers are brought into a
discourse. You and your are actually the clearest way a writer can acknowledge
the reader’s presence, but these forms are rare outside of philosophy, probably
because they imply a lack of involvement between participants. Instead, there is
enormous emphasis on binding writer and reader together through inclusive we,
which is the most frequent engagement device in academic writing. It sends a
clear signal of membership by textually constructing both the writer and the
reader as participants with similar understanding and goals. This was recognized
by my informants:
Part of what you are doing in writing a paper is getting your readers onside, not 
just getting down a list of facts, but showing that you have similar interests and con-
cerns. That you are looking at issues in much the same way they would, not spelling

everything out, but following the same procedures and asking the questions they
might have.
(Bio interview)
I often use ‘we’ to include readers. I suppose it brings out something of the collective
endeavour, what we all know and want to accomplish. I’ve never thought of it as a
strategy, but I suppose I am trying to lead readers along with me.
(ME interview)
In addition to claiming solidarity, these devices also set up a dialogue by weaving
the potential point of view of readers into the discourse, thereby anticipating
their objections, voicing their concerns, and expressing their views. Thus, we
helps guide readers through an argument and towards a preferred interpreta-
tion, often shading into explicit positioning of the reader (Example 5):
(5) Now that we have a plausible theory of depiction, we should be able to answer the
question of what static images depict. But this turns out to be not at all a straightfor-
ward matter. We seem, in fact, to be faced with a dilemma. Suppose we say that static
images can depict movement. This brings us into conﬂict with Currie’s account,......
(Phil)
Although we lack knowledge about a deﬁnitive biological function for the transcripts
from the 93D locus, their sequences provide us with an ideal system to identify a 
speciﬁc transcriptionally active site in embryonic nuclei.
(Bio)
Personal asides allow writers to address readers directly by brieﬂy interrupting the
argument to offer a comment on what has been said. While asides express some-
thing of the writer’s personality and willingness to explicitly intervene to offer a
view, they can also be seen as a key reader-oriented strategy. By turning to the
reader in mid-ﬂow, the writer acknowledges and responds to an active audience,
often to initiate a brief dialogue that is largely interpersonal. As we can see, such
comments often add more to the writer–reader relationship than to the proposi-
tional development of the discourse (Example 6):

show that both writer and readers are engaged in the same game and are in a
position to draw on shared understandings. While all writing needs to solicit
reader collusion, this kind of engagement is far more common in the soft ﬁelds.
Because they deal with greater contextual vagaries, less predictable variables,
and more diverse research outcomes, readers must be drawn in and be involved
as participants in a dialogue to a greater extent than in the sciences.
Appeals to shared knowledge seek to position readers within apparently natural-
ized boundaries of disciplinary understandings. The notion of ‘sharedness’ is
often invoked by writers to smuggle contested ideas into their argument, but here
I am simply referring to the presence of explicit markers where readers are asked
to recognize something as familiar or accepted. Obviously readers can only be
brought to agree with the writer by building on some kind of implicit contract
concerning what can be accepted, but often these constructions of solidarity
involve explicit calls asking readers to identify with particular views. In doing so,
writers are actually constructing readers by presupposing that they hold such
beliefs, assigning to them a role in creating the argument, acknowledging their
contribution while moving the focus of the discourse away from the writer to
shape the role of the reader (Example 7):
(7) Of course, we know that the indigenous communities of today have been 
reorganized by the catholic church in colonial times and after,........
(Soc)
This tendency obviously reﬂects the preponderance of brand-image advertising in
fashion merchandising.
(Mk)
Chesterton was of course wrong to suppose that Islam denied ‘even souls to women’.
(Phil)
This measurement is distinctly different from the more familiar NMR pulsed ﬁeld 
gradient measurement of solvent self-diffusion.
(Phy)
Over three-quarters of such explicit appeals to collective understandings in the
corpus were in the soft papers. Writers of scientiﬁc papers expect their readers to
have considerable domain knowledge and to be able to decode references to spe-
cialized methods, instruments, materials, and models, but these understandings
are signalled less explicitly.
Directives instruct the reader to perform an action or to see things in a way
determined by the writer. They are signalled mainly by the presence of an imper-
ative (like consider, note, and imagine); by a modal of obligation addressed to the
reader (such as must, should, and ought); and by a predicative adjective expressing
the writer’s judgement of necessity/importance (It is important to understand ...).
Directives can be seen as directing readers to engage in three main kinds of activity
(Hyland, 2002a):

2.
Physical acts.
3.
Cognitive acts.
First, textual acts are used to metadiscoursally guide readers through the discus-
sion, steering them to another part of the text or to another text (Example 8):
(8) See Lambert and Jones (1997) for a full discussion of this point.
(Soc)
Look at Table 2 again for examples of behavioristic variables.
(Mk)
Consult Cormier and Gunn 1992 for a recent survey
(EE)
Second, physical acts instruct readers how to carry out research processes or to
perform some action in the real world (Example 9):
(9) Before attempting to measure the density of the interface states, one should freeze
the motion of charges in the insulator.
(EE)
Mount the specimen on the lower grip of the machine ﬁrst, ...
(Bio)
Set the sliding amplitude at 30mm traveling distance.
(ME)
Finally, cognitive acts guide readers through a line of reasoning, or get them to
understand a point in a certain way and are therefore potentially the most
threatening type of directives. They accounted for almost half of all directives in
the corpus, explicitly positioning readers by leading them through an argument
to the writer’s claims (Example 10) or emphasizing what they should attend to in
the argument (Example 11):
(10) Consider a sequence of batches in an optimal schedule.
(EE)

(ME)
Questions are the strategy of dialogic involvement par excellence, inviting engage-
ment and bringing the interlocutor into an arena where they can be led to the
writer’s viewpoint (Hyland, 2002b). They arouse interest and encourage the
reader to explore an unresolved issue with the writer as an equal, a conversa-
tional partner, sharing his or her curiosity and following where the argument
leads. Over 80 percent of questions in the corpus, however, were rhetorical, 
presenting an opinion as an interrogative so the reader appears to be the judge,

but actually expecting no response. This kind of rhetorical positioning of readers
is perhaps most obvious when the writer poses a question only to reply immedi-
ately, simultaneously initiating and closing the dialogue (Example 12):
(12) Is it, in fact, necessary to choose between nurture and nature? My contention is
that it is not.
(Soc)
What do these two have in common, one might ask? The answer is that they share
the same politics.

Stance and engagement practices: corpus ﬁndings
Analysis of the research article corpus shows that the expression of stance and
engagement is an important feature of academic writing, with 200 occurrences
in each paper, about one every 28 words. Table 1 shows that stance markers
were about ﬁve times more common than engagement features and that hedges
were by far the most frequent feature of writer perspective in the corpus, reﬂect-
ing the critical importance of distinguishing fact from opinion and the need for
writers to present their claims with appropriate caution and regard to colleagues’
views.
The signiﬁcance of these frequencies can be more clearly understood in com-
parison to other common features of published academic writing. Biber et al.
(1999), for instance, give ﬁgures of 18.5 cases per 1000 words for passive voice
constructions and 20 per 1000 words for past tense verbs. These overt interac-
tion markers can therefore be seen as an important element of academic prose.
Perhaps more interesting, however, are the disciplinary distributions. Table 2
shows the density of features in each discipline normalized to a text length of
1000 words. As can be seen, the more discursive ‘soft’ ﬁelds of philosophy, 
marketing, sociology and applied linguistics, contained the highest proportion of

and science papers.
Stance, engagement and disciplinarity
It is clear that writers in different disciplines represent themselves, their work
and their readers in different ways, with those in the humanities and social 
sciences taking far more explicitly involved and personal positions than those in
the science and engineering ﬁelds. As I noted at the beginning of this article, the
reason for this is that the resources of language mediate their contexts, working
to construe the characteristic structures of knowledge domains and argument
forms of the disciplines that create them.
In broad terms, rhetorical practices are inextricably related to the purposes of
the disciplines. Natural scientists tend to see their goal as producing public
knowledge able to withstand the rigours of falsiﬁability and developed through
relatively steady cumulative growth (Becher, 1989). The fact that this research
often occupies considerable investments in money, training, equipment, and
expertise means it is frequently concentrated at a few sites and commits scientists
to involvement in speciﬁc research areas for many years. Problems therefore
emerge in an established context so that readers are often familiar with prior
texts and research, and that the novelty and signiﬁcance of contributions can
easily be recognized. The soft knowledge domains, in contrast, are more interpre-
tative and less abstract, producing discourses which often recast knowledge as
sympathetic understanding, promoting tolerance in readers through an ethical
rather than cognitive progression (Dillon, 1991; Hyland, 2000). There is, more-
over, less control of variables and greater possibilities for diverse outcomes, so

writers must spell out their evaluations and work harder to establish an under-
standing with readers.
While there are clear dangers in reifying the ideologies of practitioners, these
broad ontological representations have real rhetorical effects. They allow, for
instance, the sciences to emphasize demonstrable generalizations rather than
interpreting individuals, so greater burden is placed on research practices and
the methods, procedures and equipment used. New knowledge is accepted on the
basis of empirical demonstration, and science writing reinforces this by high-
lighting a gap in knowledge, presenting a hypothesis related to this gap, and then
conducting experiments and presenting ﬁndings to support the hypothesis. In
soft areas, however, the context often has to be elaborated anew, its more diverse
components reconstructed for a less cohesive readership. Writers are far less able
to rely on general understandings and on the acceptance of proven quantitative
methods to establish their claims and this increases the need for more explicit
evaluation and engagement. Personal credibility, and explicitly getting behind argu-
ments, play a far greater part in creating a convincing discourse for these writers.
The suggestion that ‘hard’ knowledge is cumulative and tightly structured
not only allows for succinct communication, but also contributes to the appar-
ently ‘strong’ claims of the sciences. The degree to which the background to a
problem and the appropriate methods for its investigation can be taken for
granted means there are relatively clear criteria for establishing or refuting
claims and this is reﬂected in writers’ deployment of evidential markers. While
writers in all disciplines used hedges in the evaluation of their statements, they
were considerably more frequent in the soft disciplines, perhaps indicating less
assurance about what colleagues could be safely assumed to accept. The use of a
highly formalized reporting system also allows writers in the hard disciplines to
minimize their presence in their texts. In the soft disciplines where what counts
as adequate explanation is less assured, interpretative variation increases and
writers must rely to a greater extent on a personal projection into the text,
through self-mention and attitude markers to invoke an intelligent reader and a
credible, collegial writer.
In addition to creating an impression of authority, integrity and credibility
through choices from the stance options, writers are able to either highlight or
downplay the presence of their readers in the text. As we have seen, the most 
frequent engagement devices in the corpus were reader pronouns and over 80
percent of these occurred in the soft discipline papers where they functioned to
appeal to scholarly solidarity, presupposing a set of mutual, discipline-identifying
understandings linking writer and reader. They also claim authority as well as
communality, however, addressing the reader from a position of conﬁdence as
several of my informants noted:
I suppose we help to ﬁnesse a positive response – we are all in this together kind of
thing. I use it to signal that I am on the same wavelength, drawing on the same
assumptions and asking the same questions.

It helps to locate you in a network. It shows that you are just doing and thinking
what they might do and think. Or what you would like them to, anyway.
(Soc interview)
Similarly, questions were largely conﬁned to the soft ﬁelds. The fact they reach
out to readers was seen as a distraction by my science informants:
Questions are quite rare in my ﬁeld I think. You might ﬁnd them in textbooks I sup-
pose, but generally we don’t use them. They seem rather intrusive, don’t they? Too
personal. We generally prefer not to be too intrusive.
(ME interview)
I am looking for the results in a paper, and to see if the method was sound. I am look-
ing for relevance and that kind of dressing is irrelevant. People don’t ask questions as
it would be seen as irrelevant. And condescending probably. 
(EE interview)
In contrast, the soft knowledge writers saw them as an important way of relating
to readers:
In my ﬁeld that’s all there are, questions. Putting the main issues in the form of
questions is a way of presenting my argument clearly and showing them I am on the
same wavelength as them.
(Phil interview)
Often I structure the argument by putting the problems that they might ask.
(Mk interview)
Finally, directives were the only interactive feature which occurred more fre-
quently in the science and engineering papers. Generally, explicit engagement is
a feature of the soft disciplines, where writers are less able to rely on the explana-
tory value of accepted procedures, but directives are a potentially risky tactic
and, as a result, most directives in the soft ﬁelds were textual, directing readers to
a reference rather than informing them how they should interpret an argument.
Two of my respondents noted this in their interviews:
I am very conscious of using words like ‘must’ and ‘consider’ and so on and use them
for a purpose. I want to say ‘Right, stop here. This is important and I want you to take
notice of it’. So I suppose I am trying to take control of the reader and getting them to
see things my way.
(Soc interview)
I am aware of the effect that an imperative can have so I tend to use the more gentle
ones. I don’t want to bang them over the head with an argument I want them to
reﬂect on what I’m saying. I use ‘consider’ and ‘let’s look at this’ rather than some-
thing stronger.
(AL interview)
The more linear and problem-oriented approach to knowledge construction in
the hard knowledge ﬁelds, on the other hand, allows arguments to be formulated
in a highly standardized code. Articles in the sciences also tend to be much
shorter, probably due to editorial efforts to accommodate the rapid growth of
knowledge and high submission rates in many sciences. These factors place a

premium on succinctness, and directives provide an economy of expression
highly valued by space-conscious editors and information-saturated scientists, as
several informants noted:
I rarely give a lot of attention to the dressing, I look for the meat – the ﬁndings – and if
the argument is sound. If someone wants to save me time in getting there then that is
ﬁne. No, I’m not worried about imperatives leading me through it.
(EE interview)
I’m very conscious of how I write and I am happy to use an imperative if it puts my
idea over clearly. Often we are trying to work to word limits anyway, squeezing fairly
complex arguments into a tight space.
(ME interview)
In sum, these different features, taken together, are important ways of situating
academic arguments in the interactions of members of disciplinary communi-
ties. They represent relatively conventional ways of making meaning and so 
elucidate a context for interpretation, showing how writers and readers make
connections, through texts, to their disciplinary cultures.
Conclusion
My claim has been that effective academic writing depends on rhetorical deci-
sions about interpersonal intrusion and I have suggested a model which attempts
to show how writers select and deploy community-sensitive linguistic resources
to represent themselves, their positions and their readers. The account I have
provided, however, is necessarily a partial one, representing only the broadest
categories of rhetorical function. There are certainly more ﬁne-grained distinc-
tions to be made among these resources which are likely to offer further insights
into the rhetorical options available to writers and the patterns of effective 
persuasion employed by different communities.
There are also obvious limitations with the kind of corpus approach I have
adopted. Unlike the detailed studies of part genres, such as Swales’ (1990) work
on introductions, Brenton’s (1996) study of conference abstracts, or Brett’s
(1994) analysis of results sections, for example, a corpus study is unable to pro-
vide information about where these features are likely to cluster. Several studies
suggest that greater writer intrusion is a characteristic of Introduction and
Discussion sections, where argument is emphasized and decisions, claims and
justiﬁcations are usually found (e.g. Gosden, 1993; Hanania and Akhtar, 1985).
While it seems to be an intuitively reasonable assumption that stance and
engagement work is most likely to be done here, the division of research papers
into rhetorically simple and detached Methods and Results, and complex, subjec-
tive and author-centred Introductions and Discussions might be unwise. Even
the most rhetorically innocent sections reveal writers’ efforts to persuade their
audience of their claims, so that stance and engagement are likely to ﬁgure, in
different ways, across the research paper. Indeed, as Knorr-Cetina (1981)
pointed out many years ago, the IMRD structure is itself a rhetorical artefact.

It should also be noted that this creation of an authorial persona is an act of
personal choice, and the inﬂuence of individual personality, conﬁdence, experi-
ence, and ideological preference are clearly important. We are not the instru-
ments of our disciplines and variables such as individuality and ideolecticity are
important limitations on the kind of analysis presented here. It may even be the
case, as John Swales (pers. comm.) has observed, that a few famous writers (per-
haps Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Sartre, and Halliday) do not play this interactive
game with their audiences. However, writers do not act in a social vacuum, and
knowledge is not constructed outside particular communities of practice. Such
communities exist in virtue of a shared set of assumptions and routines about
how to collectively deal with and represent their experiences. The ways language
is used on particular occasions are not wholly determined by these assumptions,
but a disciplinary voice can only be achieved through a process of participating
in such communities and connecting with these socially determined and
approved beliefs and value positions. In this way, independent creativity is shaped
by accountability to shared practices.
I hope to have shown, then, that stance and engagement are important 
elements both of a writer’s argument and of a disciplinary context as they seek
to bring writer and readers into a text as participants in an unfolding dialogue.
The model presented here offers a plausible description of academic interaction
and suggests how writers anticipate and understand their readers’ background
knowledge, interests, and interpersonal expectations to control how they
respond to a text and to manage the impression they gain of the writer.
