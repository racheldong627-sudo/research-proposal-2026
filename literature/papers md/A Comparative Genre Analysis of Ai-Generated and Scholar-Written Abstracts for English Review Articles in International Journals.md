A Comparative Genre Analysis of AI-generated and 
Scholar-written Abstracts for English Review Articles in 
International Journals
Abstract: There has been growing interest in the performance and efficiency of ChatGPT in 
generating academic texts. However, little empirical research has been conducted on its 
performance in producing review article abstracts. This study adopts the genre analysis approach to 
investigate the rhetorical moves of review article abstracts in hard and soft science disciplines based 
on two self-complied corpora, respectively including 160 scholar-written abstracts from four high-
impact international journals, and 160 abstracts generated by ChatGPT, with an aim to reveal the 
similarities and differences between human-written and AI-generated English review article 
abstracts. The results show significant differences between human-written and ChatGPT-generated 
abstracts, first in the frequency of 3 out of the 5 moves, and then in the sequential order of moves, 
with each type of abstracts demonstrating a preference for move sequence patterns as well as 
obligatory and optional elements. The two types of abstracts differ significantly in the frequency of 
move embedding, but share the same embedding combination patterns. These findings may deepen 
our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities and limitations in generating academic texts across 
different disciplines, help improve the generative AI system, and then highlight the complex 
relationship among the structure of academic abstracts, discipline cultures and genre knowledge.

1. Introduction 
Since OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in November, 2023, an increasing literature has been 
produced to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on scientific writing (e.g. Benichou, 2023; 
Dergaa, et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023; Huang & Tan, 2023; Salvagno et al., 2023). The evaluation 
is crucial as it might allow researchers to determine the effectiveness of the large language model 
in specific research practices (van Dis et al., 2023). Extant studies have indicated that ChatGPT 
might offer benefits for academic article writing (e.g. Benichou, 2023; Gao et al., 2023; Májovský, 
et al., 2023; Macdonald, et al., 2023). 
However, the performance of ChatGPT in generating review article abstracts remains unclear. 
Review article abstract may constitute an essential component of academic genre (Hyland, 2000; 
Hyland & Diani, 2009).  Review article abstract writing seems to be a demanding task. Some have 
argued that abstract writing could be complicated for human writers due to potential time constraints 
(El-Kassas, 2023) and difficulties faced by language learners (Al Fadda, 2012). Therefore, 
generating review article abstracts could pose a significant challenge for ChatGPT since the 
composition of review article abstracts might be influenced by factors such as knowledge of abstract 
move structure and disciplinary cultures. 
This study aims to assess ChatGPT’s efficacy in composing abstracts for review articles by 
comparing the rhetorical moves of review article abstracts  respectively generated  by ChatGPT and 
composed by human writers across four social and natural science disciplines, with an aim to deepen

our understanding of ChatGPT’s performance in academic writing and provide valuable insights 
for refining and optimizing the generative AI technology by illuminating the intricate associations 
between rhetorical moves and disciplinary cultures in academic text generation.
2. Literature Review
2.1 Review Article Abstracts Writing
An abstract refers to “a brief, comprehensive summary of the contents of the paper” (American 
Psychological Association, 2020, p.38). Review article abstracts are an essential part of review 
articles, which have the explicit purpose of evaluating the research and benefiting the construction 
of knowledge of various disciplines as well as facilitating the social cohesiveness of scholarly 
communities (Hyland, 2000; Hyland & Diani, 2009). High-quality abstracts should be concise, self-
sufficient, unbiased, and provide complete and accurate information (Bavdekar & Gogtay, 2015).
Abstract writing would be highly important, for well-written abstracts could help researchers 
to appeal to readers and promote their studies. Abstracts could shape readers’ decisions on whether 
the accompanying article merits further reading (Hyland, 2000). Abstract writing may also be 
challenging and time-consuming. Academic writing could be a sophisticated and effortful skill, 
especially for language learners (Al Fadda, 2012; Al-Mukdad, 2019; Ma, 2021; Biber & Gray, 2010; 
Evans & Green, 2007). For example, English academic writing may be inherently difficult for most 
writers, particularly for English as a second language (L2) and English as foreign language (EFL) 
students (Lin & Morrison, 2021). Similarly, acquiring proficiency in academic writing could be a 
significant hurdle for freshmen (Horstmanshof & Brownie, 2013). Furthermore, non-native English 
students might perceive academic writing as “a formidable and daunting academic undertaking” 
mainly because of sociocultural challenges and linguistic difficulties (Bakhou & Bouhania 2020, p. 
254). Abstract writing may be influenced by disciplinary cultures. Academic writing, the formation 
of knowledge, the cultures of various disciplines and social interactions are all closely interlinked 
(Hyland, 2000). 
2.2 Genre and Move Analysis
Genre is generally accepted as a rhetorical, socially contextual category of discourse in the 
field of discourse analysis (Bhatia, 1993; Martin, 2009; Swales, 1990, 2004; Hyland, 2015). The 
defining characteristic of a genre was its communicative purpose (Swales, 1990). Genres processed 
recurrent configurations of cultural meanings with social purposes that would be achieved 
progressively (Martin, 2009). Moreover, genres, as community-based actions, might shape 
persuasive arguments and reinforce group identity and disciplinary practices (Hyland, 2015).
Genre analysis is generally recognized as a widely used method for examining the structure 
and purpose of non-literary genres. It has a set of analytic methods used for examining various 
genres within situated contexts (Tardy, 2011). Additionally, it could serve as a tool for improving 
educational methodologies in areas like rhetoric, composition studies, professional writing,  English 
for specific purposes (ESP), etc. (Hyon, 1996).
John Swales has made a significant contribution to genre analysis of academic discourses. In 
his landmark work Genre Analysis, Swales (1990) introduced the CARS (Create a Research Space) 
model for investigating the move structure of article introductions, and the IMRD (i.e. Introduction–
Method–Results–Discussion) model for scrutinizing the move structure of full-length empirical 
research articles (RA). He advocated for a genre-based approach to English for Academic Purposes 
(EAP) and showed how research and pedagogical application can be intertwined (Aull & Swales,

2015).
Move analysis is a widely used genre analysis approach. It primarily focuses on the rhetorical 
moves of a genre. A move usually refers to a coherent unit of speech or writing that serves a specific 
communicative purpose in a conversation or discourse (Swales, 2004). When conducting move 
analysis, researchers could first identify general structure patterns and initial move categories from 
a representative text corpus, then determine individual rhetorical moves, distinguishing between 
obligatory and optional moves, and the possibilities for the sequence of moves (Tardy & Swales, 
2014). This analysis, either qualitative or quantitative, may extend to the analysis of the “steps” or 
sub-moves of each move. In addition, it is crucial to note that moves are basically considered 
rhetorical categories, not grammatical ones and a move may vary in size and be potentially realized 
non-verbally.
2.3 Move Structure of Academic Paper Abstracts 
The move structure of academic paper abstracts refers to the rhetorical discourse units of the 
abstracts. The structure may be diversified. Different move structure of academic paper abstracts 
have been found, such as 4-move pattern (i.e. [Introducing purpose], [Describing methodology], 
[Summarizing results], [Presenting conclusions]) (Bhatia, 1993), 5-move pattern (i.e. [Situating the 
research], [Presenting the research], [Describing the methodology], [Summarizing the results], 
[Discussing the research] (Santos, 1996), and 6-move pattern (i.e. [Setting the background for the 
study and its importance], [Mentioning gaps addressed by the study], [Stating the purpose, question, 
hypothesis of study], [Identifying the methodology], [Stating the findings or argument], [Offering 
concluding remarks]) (Tessuto, 2015). Besides, previous studies have shown that moves of 
academic article abstracts could be classified as conventional and optional (Tanko, 2017). 
Furthermore, move embedding and the reversal of the sequential order of moves might be two 
typical characteristics of academic paper abstracts (Santos, 1993; Bhatia, 1993).
2.4 The Application of ChatGPT in Academic Writing 
ChatGPT, referring to Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, is a large language model 
(LLM). It allows users to interact with it using prompts and is capable of generating high-quality 
texts. ChatGPT is built upon GPT-3.5, one of the most extensive large language models to date, 
with over 175 billion parameters (Shen et al., 2023). Its training data consist of a wide variety of 
internet texts, such as books, articles, websites, etc. Particularly, it utilizes reinforcement learning 
from human feedback for training. This method helps ChatGPT to fine-tune its responses based on 
human evaluators’ inputs. Consequently, ChatGPT has greatly improved in understanding users’ 
prompts and generating human-like texts.
Previous studies have shown that ChatGPT could be used in various academic writing tasks, 
such as drafting research articles (e.g. Benichou, 2023; Májovský, et al., 2023; Macdonald, et al., 
2023), generating academic article and conference abstracts (e.g. Babl & Babl, 2023; Gao et al., 
2023), writing peer review reports (Hosseini & Horbach, 2023), and producing scientific case 
reports (Buholayka, et al., 2023). For instance, evaluating the article abstracts generated by 
ChatGPT for 50 scientific medical papers suggested that the lexicogrammatical expressions of the 
abstracts generated by ChatGPT seemed to be more formulaic vis-à-vis those of human-written 
abstracts (Gao et al., 2023). In addition, the text generated by ChatGPT seems to be more generic 
and less tailored to a specific context. The output from ChatGPT may not fully emulate human-like 
text, occasionally displaying repetitive phrases or words, along with unusual or inconsistent 
language usage (Cotton et al., 2023). Furthermore, ChatGPT can be used to help editors with

repetitive and tedious tasks, promote the spread of new research ideas, and save time and resources 
by drafting findings and formatting papers according to journal standards. On the other hand, the 
ethical issues with ChatGPT cannot be ignored, including authorship ambiguity, plagiarism, and 
missing references in its outputs (Lund et al., 2023).
2.5 Existing Gaps and the Present Study
Extant literature has recognized that review article appears be a key genre in academic fields 
(Hyland, 2000; Hyland & Diani, 2009) and abstract writing was considered important (Hyland 
(2000) and challenging for most writers, particularly for L2 and EFL learners (Al Fadda, 2012; Al-
Mukdad, 2019; Ma, 2021; Biber & Gray, 2010; Evans & Green, 2007). Besides, previous studies 
have shown that ChatGPT could be used in many academic writing tasks (e.g. Benichou, 2023; 
Májovský, et al., 2023; Macdonald, et al., 2023) and be conducive to the abstract writing of research 
papers (Gao et al. 2023). However, what is not yet clearly understood is the actual performance of 
ChatGPT in generating review article abstracts.
In order to address this research gap, we conducted a comparative genre analysis using two 
self-compiled corpora—the Corpus of Human-Generated Review Article Abstracts and the Corpus 
of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts. The following four questions were attempted to 
be answered: 
1) What is the overall distribution of moves across the two corpora?
2) What is the distribution of moves across the four disciplines across the two corpora?
3) What is the sequential order of the moves across the two corpora?
4) What is the move embedding across the two corpora?
3. Research Methodology
3.1 Data Collection and Corpus Compilation
The data used in the current study came from two self-complied corpora: the Corpus of 
Human-Generated Review Article Abstracts (henceforth CHGRAA) and the Corpus of ChatGPT-
Generated Review Article Abstracts (henceforth CCGRAA). CHGRAA consisted of the abstracts 
of 160 review articles published in major journals of the following four social and natural science 
disciplines: Anthropology, Education, Engineering, and Physics (Becher, 1994). One journal was 
selected in each discipline based on Scimago Journal Rank (SJR) indicator in 2022. Forty review 
articles were selected in each journal in the period of 2018-2022. CCGRAA included 160 review 
article abstracts, which were generated by ChatGPT merely based on the content (without pictures, 
tables and figures)1 of the 160 human-written review articles. The corpus information was provided 
in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the number of tokens in each discipline was largely comparable.

Corpus of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts. MW, TTR, AWL and MWL refer to the average words 
of abstracts, type/token ratio, and average word length and average sentence length, respectively.
In the generation process, the review article was divided into several sections. This was mainly 
due to the character input limit for each interaction with the ChatGPT 3.5 version. As for the abstract 
generation, the following prompts were fed to the 3.5 model, the details of which were as follows:
(1) 我接下来要在多个对话中，提供给你用「@」编号的文章内容，格式为@i=<内容>，
请先记住它们，不要提供各自的摘要，可以吗? (English translation: I will provide article 
content marked with 「@ 」numbers in the format of @i=<the content> in the following 
conversations. Please remember them first without providing summaries for each, okay?)
(2) 请记住@i，不要提供摘要: (English translation: Please remember @i and do not provide 
a summary:)(i=1, 2, 3, …n-1)
(3) 请为@n 到@m 的内容生成一份符合期刊综述论文格式的英文摘要，字数不要超
过……个单词。(English translation: Please generate an English abstract for the content from @n 
to @m in the format of a journal review paper, and the word count should not exceed ... words.1) 
3.2 Approach to Move Analysis
The initial step in our research was to reliably annotate the sub-moves of the review article 
abstracts. To ensure the reliability and validity issues associated with the form-oriented 
methodology (Lu, et al., 2021), a function-oriented approach was implemented, which implied the 
annotation was performed based solely on the function or content of the abstracts in this study. The 
entire corpus was annotated for moves and sub-moves, and then the frequency and sequential 
pattern of moves, and move embedding were examined. In addition, when the frequency of moves 
was calculated, consideration was given to whether a move was obligatory or optional if it appeared 
in 90% of 160 review article abstracts (Santos, 1996). Specifically, a move that occurs in 90% of 
the 160 abstracts in the corpus was labeled as obligatory while a move that occurs below 90% was 
counted as being optional.
3.3 The Adapted Framework for Move Analysis of Review Article Abstracts
The objectives of the analysis were twofold: to establish a comprehensive analytical 
framework, and then to use the framework to conduct reliable annotation of moves within our 
corpora. Santos’ (1996) five-move structure model was adopted as the base framework (as shown 
1 The pictures, tables and figures in original human-written review article abstracts cannot be fed to ChatGPT 3.5 
version, so those data have been deleted when we complied the Corpus of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article 
Abstracts.
1 The maximum word limit for each abstract generated by ChatGPT was the same as the maximum word limit for 
human-written abstracts. For example, if one human-written abstract had 200 words, the maximum word limit for 
ChatGPT-generated abstracts was also 200 words.

The model has been widely acknowledged within the EAP community (Biber & Conrad, 2019; 
Jiang & Hyland, 2017; Omidian, Shahriari & Siyanova-Chanturia, 2018; Pho, 2008) as being adept 
at covering the move structure of both structured and unstructured abstracts (Hartley, Sydes & 
Blurton, 1996). However, we anticipated that some adjustments to this model would be necessary 
due to the interdisciplinary variations present in the review article abstract writing practices found 
in our data. The final analytical framework was provided in Table 3. In order to  ensure the reliability 
of the adapted framework and its application in the annotation, our analysis was carried out in two 
stages.

During the initial phase, three annotators1 independently analyzed a random selection of 32 
abstracts, which represented 10% of the total 320 abstracts collected. They tried to apply Santos’ 
(1996) move structure model to the texts, and held several extensive meetings to discuss changes 
to the move structure model and to reconcile any differences in their individual analyses of the 32 
abstracts. It was found that minor modifications were required for Move 1 (Contextualizing the 
research) and Move 2 (Introducing the research), with the removal of three sub-moves since they 
were not present in the corpus data. In the subsequent phase, inter-rater reliability at the sub-move 
level was assessed to determine the level of subjectivity in the annotation process. The three pairs 
achieved an average Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.978 (SPSS 23), indicating a high level of 
agreement. The remaining texts were then analyzed by one author and carefully reviewed by another 
author. All differences identified were collaboratively resolved by the four researchers in a series 
of extensive team discussions.
During the whole process, we adhered to Swales’ (2004) definition of moves as “discoursal or 
rhetorical units performing coherent communicative functions in texts” (pp. 228–229), referring to 
moves as functional rather than formal units. Also, the analysis of move structure has been utilized 
to examine the significance of specific moves (whether they were obligatory or optional), the 
sequential positioning of these moves, and their embedding (Samraj, 2014). Therefore, these three 
characteristics of moves have been integrated into our adapted framework for the analysis of move 
structure of review article abstracts  (see Figure 1 ).

Note: F(CC) and F(CH) refer to the move frequency in the Corpus of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts 
(CCGRAA) and the Corpus of Human-Generated Review Article Abstracts (CHGRAA), respectively. P(CC) and 
P(CH) represent the percentages of move usage in two different corpora, CCGRAA and CHGRAA, respectively. χ2 
refers to the Chi-square test value. S(p) stands for the p value. The asterisks (*) indicate significance level: (*) means 
statistically significant at the 0.05 level; (**) means statistically significant at the 0.01 level; (***) means statistically 
significant at the 0.001 level. The “+” and “-” signs on the right side indicate “overuse” and “underuse”.
As evident from Table 4, the Chi-square test1 showed statistically significant differences in the 
frequency of occurrence between Move 1, Move 3, and Move 5 across the Corpus of ChatGPT-
Generated Review Article Abstracts (CCGRAA) and the Corpus of Human-Generated Review 
Article Abstracts (CHGRAA). This finding indicates that the overall distribution of the moves in 
review article abstract across the two corpora is fairly different. Specifically, Move 1 (Situating 
the research), Move 3 (Describing the methodology), and Move 5 (Discussing the research) 
occurred with significantly different frequencies in the two types of abstracts. For example:
(1) Drawing on various scholarly perspectives, including linguistic anthropology and 
related fields, the review explores how individuals’ recognition of vulnerability and 
their emotional responses shaped new forms of social engagement. [Move 3: 
Describing the methodology] (Anthropology by ChatGPT)
The findings suggest that there are discernible and statistically significant patterns in the ways 
that ChatGPT and humans write abstracts. In other words, even though both humans and ChatGPT 
were capable of writing review article abstracts, their respective methodologies were not identical. 
There existed substantial and statistically significant differences in their writing styles or strategies, 
as evidenced by the different frequencies of usage of Move 1, Move 3, and Move 5.
However, no significant differences were found in Move 2 (Presenting the research) and 
Move 4 (Summarizing the results) across the two corpora. This indicates both humans and 
ChatGPT might be more likely to use similar move structures when presenting research and 
summarizing results in review articles abstracts.  Table 5 provides an overview of the distribution 
of sub-moves across the two corpora.

(CHGRAA), respectively. P(CC) and P(CH) represent the percentages of move usage in two different corpora, 
CCGRAA and CHGRAA, respectively. χ2 refers to the Chi-square test value. S(p) stands for the p value. The 
asterisks (*) indicate significance level: (*) means statistically significant at the 0.05 level; (**) means statistically 
significant at the 0.01 level; (***) means statistically significant at the 0.001 level. The “+” and “-” signs on the 
right side indicate “overuse” and “underuse”.
Considerable variations were found in the use of sub-moves to fulfill the rhetorical functions 
in the two corpora. Specifically, in terms of the use of sub-move 1A (Stating current knowledge), 
sub-move 1B (Stating a problem) and sub-move 2B (Indicating main purpose), there was a 
significantly lower occurrence in the ChatGPT-generated abstracts, while there was a notably higher 
occurrence in the human-written abstracts. On the contrary, in terms of the usage of sub-move 2A 
(Indicating main features), sub-move 5A (Drawing conclusions) and sub-move 5B (Giving 
recommendations), there was a significantly higher occurrence in the ChatGPT-generated 
abstracts, while there was a notably lower occurrence in the human-written abstracts. For example:
(2) Since the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 
2006, the educational trajectories of children with disabilities have increasingly 
become the focus of public interest and the subject of empirical research. The 
transition to school has received special attention in this research. [Sub-move 1A: 
Stating current knowledge)] Yet a systematic overview of current research in this 
area is not available. [Sub-move 1B : Stating a problem)]   (Education by Humans)
(3) This review aims to give an overview on the latest and most promising strategies to 
improve the bioactivity of lactic acid-based materials, especially focusing on 
biomolecule-free bulk approaches such as blending, copolymerization or composite 
fabrication. [Sub-move 2B: Indicating main purpose)] (Engineering by Humans)
(4) Here we review the theory of quantum systems with ultrastrong coupling, discussing 
entangled ground states…. We also overview the multitude of experimental setups, 
including superconducting circuits… We conclude by discussing the many potential 
applications that these achievements enable in physics and chemistry. [Sub-move

This indicates that the algorithm used to generate review article abstracts by ChatGPT may not 
fully replicate human writing patterns. Specifically, ChatGPT may fail to adequately describe the 
background information of the review topic, to acknowledge knowledge gaps or controversial 
arguments, or to state the aims of the study. It may also overstate or overstress the summary or main 
content of the article, the value of the research and the potential applications and recommendations 
for future research.
Moreover, we calculated the percentage of each move of 160 abstracts in the Corpus of

ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts (CCGRAA) to determine the obligatory and optional 
moves. As mentioned above, for a move to be classified as obligatory, it needs to be present in 90% 
of the 160 abstracts in the corpus. A move might be deemed optional if its occurrence may be less 
than 90%. The results showed that the obligatory moves in ChatGPT-generated abstracts were Move 
1 (107.50%) and Move 5 (96.25%), while the optional moves were Move 1(45.63%), Move 3 
(15.00%), and Move 4 (42.50%). However, the obligatory moves in human-written abstracts were 
Move 1 (106.25%) and Move 2 (106.88%), while the optional moves were Move 3 (28.13%), Move 
4 (37.50%), and Move 45(36.25%). This suggests that the typical order of the moves in a ChatGPT-
generated or a human-written review article abstract based on the move sequence patterns identified 
in the corpus can be described as follows, respectively (the bracketed elements and plus signs 
between them describe the typical order of the functional units, the parentheses indicate optional 
moves):
ChatGPT-generated Abstracts: M1 [(Situating the research)] + M2 [Presenting the research]

Article Abstracts (CHGRAA), respectively. P(CCATH) and P(CHATH) represent the percentages of move usage 
in anthropology of two different corpora, CCGRAA and CHGRAA, respectively.
As demonstrated in Table 6, there were substantial differences in the application of moves and 
sub-moves within the discipline of anthropology. In specific terms, the use of sub-move 1A (Stating 
current knowledge), sub-move 1B (Stating a problem), and Move 4 (Summarizing the results), 
was noticeably less frequent in the ChatGPT-created abstracts compared to the human-written ones, 
which showed a substantially higher occurrence of these elements. Conversely, the utilization of 
sub-move 5A (Drawing conclusions) was distinctly more prevalent in the ChatGPT-produced 
abstracts, while it was considerably less common in the human-composed ones. This implies that 
in generating review article abstracts in the field of anthropology, ChatGPT may not be sufficient 
in accurately depicting the research topic’s background information, acknowledging contentious 
arguments or gaps in knowledge, or in summarizing the results. Additionally, it might over-
highlight the significance of the research.

ChatGPT, while these elements were considerably more common in the abstracts created by humans. 
This suggests that in the creation of review article abstracts in education, ChatGPT may face 
difficulties in offering relevant background information on the research subject, recognizing 
knowledge deficiencies, efficiently summarizing the results, or possibly neglecting the 
methodology.

(Summarizing the results), sub-move 5A (Drawing conclusions), and sub-move 5B (Giving

example:
(7) Additionally, the use of predictive systems based on neural networks is recommended 
for a comprehensive understanding of the SES-academic performance relationship 
in higher education. [Sub-move 5B: Giving recommendations] (Education by 
ChatGPT)
This indicates that ChatGPT-generated abstracts might be more likely to summarize results, 
draw conclusions, and provide recommendations more frequently than human-written abstracts in 
engineering review article abstracts. This discrepancy could potentially reflect differences in 
stylistic or structural preferences between the large language model and human writers in producing 
review article abstracts in the field of engineering.
In conclusion, these findings suggest that the large language model (ChatGPT) may exhibit 
limitations when generating review article abstracts across various fields. In anthropology and 
education, ChatGPT might not sufficiently depict the research topic’s background, acknowledge 
contentious arguments or knowledge gaps, and may overstate the research’s significance. 
Meanwhile, in physics and engineering, ChatGPT appears to emphasize drawing conclusions, 
summarizing results, and offering recommendations over other aspects, potentially indicating

It was evident that a typical abstract written by a human may follow a 2-move sequence (M1-
M2) or a 5-move sequence (M1-M2-M3-M4-M5). In contrast, a typical abstract generated by 
ChatGPT may adhere to a 2-move sequence (M2-M5) or a 3-move sequence (M1-M2-M5). For 
example:

evidence of its ability to enhance learning is mixed. [M1] …Therefore, in order to

[M5] (Anthropology by ChatGPT)
This suggests that the machine-generated (ChatGPT) abstracts and human-authored abstracts 
might exhibit different move structure patterns. The humans were more likely to use a more 
elaborate sequence, incorporating all five moves in some cases. On the other hand, the large 
language model seemed to favor simpler, shorter move sequences, possibly omitting or overlooking 
certain moves or sub-moves. This indicates that the large language model might not fully capture 
the complexity and nuance often present in human-written review article abstracts.
Furthermore, fourteen distinct move sequence patterns were observed in the ChatGPT-
generated abstracts, while the human-written abstracts displayed 26 move sequence patterns. This 
suggests that the human-written abstracts could demonstrate a greater diversity in their move 
sequence patterns compared to the ChatGPT-generated abstracts. This might be due to human 
authors’ creative ability to adapt their writing style for different social contexts, or communicative 
purposes, whereas the machine-generated text might be more rigid or limited due to the 
programming or the sparsity of training data encountered by the large language model.

Eight and eleven different move sequence patterns were identified in these two disciplines, 
respectively. As can be seen from the table, SM1A-SM2A was the most used move sequence in 
these two kinds of review article abstracts. SM1A and SM2A represented the sub-move 1A (Stating 
current knowledge) and sub-move 2A (Indicating main features), respectively. This suggests 
that human scholars might prefer to present the background information and demonstrate the main 
content or the scope of the review articles in those two disciplines. The preference of human

scholars to display that information in the abstracts might be due to the influence of disciplinary 
cultures, or to their knowledge of the genre of the review article. In other words, in physics and 
engineering, human researchers might prefer a more detailed, context-oriented approach when 
writing the review article abstracts.

Note: F(AN) and F(ED) refer to the frequency of move sequence patterns in anthropology and education of the 
Corpus of Human-Generated Review Article Abstracts (CHGRAA), respectively. P(AN) and P(ED) represent the 
percentages of move sequence patterns in anthropology and education of CHGRAA.
We identified 21 and 29 different move sequence patterns in these two disciplines, respectively. 
As can be seen from the table, within the abstracts of review articles from anthropology and 
education, the most commonly employed move sequences were SM1A-SM2A and SM1A-SM1B-
SM2B-M3-M4-SM5A, respectively. This implies that human reviewers in anthropology might be 
more likely to present the background or the context of the topic in question and tend to provide the 
summary of the content or the overview of topics dealt with in the review. When it comes to 
education review articles, human writers may prefer to provide a more structured abstract, covering 
the background, the knowledge gap or the niche, the aims, the methodology, the results and the 
significance of the review topic. 
Furthermore, as can be seen from Table 11 and 12, there were more diversified move sequence 
patterns in the soft disciplines in comparison with those patterns in the hard disciplines. This 
indicates that human reviewers in the soft disciplines might be more likely to organize the structure 
of the review article abstracts in a flexible way.
4.4 The Move Embedding Across CCGRAA and CHGRAA in RA Abstracts
The move embedding refers to the blending of moves into the same statement (Santos, 1996). 
We identified 5 embedded moves in ChatGPT-generated review article abstracts and 22 in human-
written ones. In the ChatGPT-generated abstracts, most fully embedded moves (N=5) were 
composed of Move 2 (Presenting the research) and Move 3 (Describing the methodology). In 
the human-written abstracts, most of the fully embedded moves (N=10) also consisted of Move 2 
and Move 3. Moreover, Move 3 and Move 4 (Summarizing the results) were frequently embedded 
together (N=6) in the abstracts written by humans. The Chi-square test demonstrated statistically 
significant differences in the frequency of move embedding between the Corpus of ChatGPT-
Generated Review Article Abstracts (CCGRAA) and the Corpus of Human-Generated Review 
Article Abstracts (CHGRAA) (χ2=10.36, p <0.01). This implies that move embedding might occur 
significantly less frequently in the review article abstracts generated by ChatGPT compared to those 
produced by humans. It also suggests that ChatGPT may generate simpler or more straightforward 
sentence structures compared to human writers when producing the abstracts. For example: 
(10) Drawing on various scholarly perspectives, including linguistic anthropology and 
related fields [M3], the review explores how individuals’ recognition of vulnerability 
and their emotional responses shaped new forms of social engagement. [M2] 
(Education by ChatGPT)
(11) Drawing on the anthropology of violence, genocide, and the state, within the context 
of anthropology’s colonial turn since the 1970s, [M3] this article describes how 
states within colonial modernity create and exploit population-differentiated death 
through practices of social death, slow violence, and slow death. [M2] 
(Anthropology by ChatGPT)
(12) This study aimed to investigate the effect of feedback on students’ academic 
achievement in a technology-rich environment [M2] through a systematic and 
quantitative synthesis of the studies conducted over several decades. [M3] 
(Education by Humans)
(13) Based on the analysis of 66 selected empirical and non-empirical articles [M3], the 
results show that there is a reciprocal relationship between barriers that occur at 
the macro and micro levels. [M4] (Education by Humans)

5. Discussion
Our research primarily focused on comparing the rhetorical moves in review article abstracts 
generated by ChatGPT versus those written by humans across four soft and hard science disciplines, 
attempting to identify their similarities and differences, along with an evaluation of the ChatGPT’s 
performance and efficiency in generating these abstracts. One of the important findings reveals that 
the overall pattern of the moves in review article abstracts varied considerably between the Corpus 
of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts (CCGRAA) and the Corpus of Human-Generated 
Review Article Abstracts (CHGRAA). Notably, Move 1 (i.e. Situating the research), Move 3 (i.e. 
Describing the methodology), and Move 5 (i.e. Discussing the research) occurred with markedly 
different frequencies in the two kinds of abstracts. On the contrary, no notable differences were 
observed in Move 2 (i.e. Presenting the research) and Move 4 (i.e. Summarizing the results) across 
the two corpora. This indicates that both humans and the large language model may demonstrate 
similarities when presenting research and summarizing results in review article abstracts, but might 
differ in presenting the background, describing the methodology, and discussing the results. 
Another intriguing finding was that human writers often used a more comprehensive move sequence 
pattern, at times including all five moves, whereas ChatGPT preferred less complicated and shorter 
move sequences, possibly omitting some moves or sub-moves. This finding may partially support 
the assumption that the writing practices in different science disciplines could be influenced by 
disciplinary cultures, social contexts, recontextualization, the authors’ partly language-dependent 
genre-specific knowledge and language-independent metacognitive genre awareness (Hyland, 2000, 
2004; Johns, 2008; Kim & Belcher, 2018; Martin & Rose, 2008; Swales, 1990; Tardy, Sommer-
Farias, & Gevers, 2020).
Another important finding was that ChatGPT-generated abstracts demonstrate a less diversity 
in their move sequence patterns compared to the human-written abstracts. This result is consistent 
with prior findings on the performance of ChatGPT in generating academic journal articles (Gao, 
et al., 2023; Wang, et al., 2023). Specifically, the abstracts produced by ChatGPT appeared to be 
more ambiguous and standardized (Gao, et al., 2023). Similarly, the abstracts generated by 
ChatGPT showed a high degree of uniformity and strong rationality, leaning towards academic 
discourse such as summaries (Wang et al., 2023). In contrast, abstracts written by human scholars 
displayed distinct individuality, frequently employing terms specific to certain research contexts 
and policy-related vocabulary. These variations may be partially explained by the assumption that 
human authors might possess more creative capacities to modify their writing style according to 
different social contexts or communicative purposes. On the other hand, the texts generated by 
ChatGPT could be more inflexible or constrained due to the programming or the scarcity of data 
the large language model has been trained on. Since ChatGPT was a kind of deep learning model 
(Baidoo-Anu & Ansah, 2023), and it was trained on a large dataset of text, such as books and articles, 
and learns to generate text that was similar to the text it was trained on, so it might suffer from some 
data training problems, such as limited training data, a lack of relevant data, model overfitting, and 
an unbalanced dataset (Bansal, Sharma, & Kathuria, 2022). 
The most interesting finding was that in both ChatGPT-generated and human-written abstracts, 
the majority of fully embedded moves were comprised of Move 2 (i.e. Presenting the research) and 
Move 3 (i.e. Describing the methodology). This finding is in agreement with Santos (1996) findings 
which showed, Move 3 was more likely to merge with Move 2, either partially or totally on most 
occasions. The embedding of two (or more) moves was a typical phenomenon across all five moves

6. Conclusion and Implications
Recently, the role of ChatGPT in text generation has received increased attention across a 
number of disciplines. Previous research suggests that ChatGPT has the potential to enhance the 
generation of academic texts. This study annotated a corpus of 320 review article abstracts 
generated by ChatGPT and human writers in four soft and hard science disciplines, respectively. 
This study provides an assessment of the performance and efficiency of ChatGPT in generating 
academic texts. Our results reveal significant differences in the types of rhetorical moves, move 
patterns, and the frequency of move embedding between abstracts generated by ChatGPT and those 
authored by humans. This broadens the use of move analysis to the abstracts of review articles 
generated by ChatGPT and human authors in both soft and hard disciplines, thereby enhancing our 
understanding of how the abstract writing practices in various disciplines could be affected by 
factors such as disciplinary cultures, social contexts, the authors’ specific genre knowledge, the 
awareness of genre, etc. The insights gained from this research offer a contribution to the 
understanding of the review genre in academic writing and underscore the degree to which move 
analysis provides a comprehensive view of the structural patterns of a review article abstract. In 
addition to its theoretical contributions to discourse analysis, this research also has practical benefits 
for those looking to enhance the text generation capabilities of large language models, or those 
interested in genre-based EAP pedagogy for novices or non-native speakers.
The present study was subject to several limitations. The principal limitation of this study was 
that we only examined some review articles from two hard and two soft disciplines and our data 
analysis relied heavily on small sample sizes. Besides, our focus was mainly on the rhetorical moves 
of the abstracts generated by both ChatGPT and human writers. Finally, another limitation arises 
from the absence of relevant prior studies directly based on the analytical framework used in this 
study for these two types of journal review article abstracts. This means that it is unlikely to take 
into account the effect size of our results. As a result, future studies could cover more disciplines 
and consider the distinctions in sub-types of review articles and structured and unstructured 
abstracts. Furthermore, grammatical metaphor and stance markers could be another two crucial 
factors which might be worthy of being used to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in generating 
academic texts.
Our analyses suggest that ChatGPT may not be used to generate review article abstracts, for it 
cannot fully demonstrate the move structure of the genre and showcases the formulaic patterns of 
the move structure of the genre. Specifically, ChatGPT cannot generate some sub-moves, such as 
the Sub-move: Stating a problem, and shows less diversity and flexibility in the move patterns and 
the sequential orders, this might undermine the capability of ChatGPT in generating the review 
article abstracts. The move structure of the abstracts may be used to evaluate the performance of 
the ability of ChatGPT in academic text generation.
