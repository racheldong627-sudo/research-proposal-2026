person pronoun

Abstract
Academic writing has traditionally been thought of as a convention-bound monolithic
entity that involves distant, convoluted and impersonal prose. However, recent research has
suggested a growing recognition that there is room for negotiation of identity within
academic writing, and thus academic writing need not be totally devoid of a writer's
presence. In this article, we explore the notion of writer identity in academic essays by
focusing on ®rst person pronouns, arguably the most visible manifestation of a writer's
presence in a text. Our main argument is that the ®rst person pronoun in academic writing
is not a homogeneous entity. Accordingly, we set up a typology of six dierent identities
behind the ®rst person pronoun in academic writing. We then apply this framework to a
speci®c examination of the essays of 27 ®rst-year undergraduates at the National University
of Singapore. We focus on how the identities of these student writers are revealed through
uses of the ®rst person pronoun, and re¯ect on the implications of our results on issues of
critical thinking and writing education at the tertiary level. # 1999 The American

1. Introduction
Students beginning tertiary education may ®nd themselves in an academic
environment which is very dierent from what they are used to. They are quickly
placed in a position where they have to `appropriate (or be appropriated by) a
specialized discourse' (Bartholomae, 1985, p. 135), often before they have learned
how to properly utilize this `specialized discourse' of higher education. With
academic writing conventions rarely taught explicitly (a problem noted by several
researchers, including Lillis, 1997; Delpit, 1986), many students approach their
assignments with a vague notion of academic writing as some monolithic entity,
involving dry, convoluted, distant and impersonal prose that must be mastered in
order to gain membership into the `academic discourse community' (see Clark
(1992) for a good introduction to this concept). Recent research (Clark, 1992;
Ivanic, 1994, 1995, 1998; Ivanic & Simpson, 1992; Lillis, 1997), however, suggests
a growing trend away from the traditional notion of academic writing as distant
and impersonal, towards a recognition that academic writing need not be totally
devoid of the writer's presence. The issue of how writers create identities for
themselves in their academic writing thus emerges as a very pertinent area of
research. Recognising that a writer's identity in any text is created by and revealed
through a combination of his or her many discoursal choices, we have decided to
focus on just one of these aspectsÐthe writer's use of ®rst person pronouns.
2. Writer roles and writer identity in academic writing
The phrase `creating identities' implies a whole philosophy of thinking that has
become increasingly accessible and accepted through the work of Michael
Halliday and others of the Systemic school of linguistics (Halliday, 1994, 1998;
Martin, 1989). In this school of thought, `reality' is not something that exists
independently as an objective entity, but is instead a construct of human creation
through language. In other words, language does not merely re¯ect an existing
reality, but actually creates that reality. If we see the notion of self as one of the
aspects of `reality', we can then extrapolate from the above viewpoint to say that
the idea of the self, too, is not ®xed. Language does not serve merely as a tool to
express a self that we already have, but serves as a resource for creating that self.
This view is shared by Roland Barthes and William Coles (Harris, 1987), and
Robert Brooke (1991).
If the self is not a ®xed pre-language entity, then writers can be sensitized to the
possibilities of inventing their `selves' through their writing. They can, as it were,
break free from the real or imagined moulds of behaviour imposed upon them by
their discourse situations to inhabit dierent, chosen roles in their writing.
The study of writer identity in academic writing is a relatively unexplored area
of research. Cherry (1988), one of the few researchers who has speci®cally
addressed this issue, distinguishes between ethos and persona in writing, with ethos
R. Tang, S. John / English for Speci®c Purposes 18 (1999) S23±S39
S24


## Page 3

referring to the personal characteristics (e.g. intelligent, funny, responsible, etc.)
that a reader attributes to a writer based on textual evidence, and persona
referring to the roles which a writer adopts while producing a particular piece of
writing. As Cherry does not explicitly discuss the range of possible roles a person
can hold, often simultaneously, we would like to suggest three main levels at
which people can hold or perform rolesÐthe societal level, at the discourse level,
and at the genre level. Ivanic (1998, p. 46) distinguishes between discourse and
genre as follows:
Any piece of language might be categorized as primarily belonging to a
particular genre (for example poem genre, or newspaper editorial genre), and
can be shown to have characteristics of a particular discourse (for example,
`anti-war discourse' or `natural science discourse'). So a single discourse can be
found in several dierent genres. In the same way, a single genre (for example,
undergraduate essay genre), also provides the container for a wide variety of
discourses (for example, philosophy discourse, natural science discourse).
Societal roles are the identities that are, in a sense, inherent to a person (e.g.
mother, father, son, daughter, American, Singaporean). Discourse roles are the
identities that a person acquires by participation in a particular discourse
community (e.g. a lawyer or a client in the legal discourse community, a doctor or
a patient in the medical discourse community). Generally, these roles only hold
within the con®nes of that discourse community. For example, a person is not `a
client' outside of the courtroom or the lawyer's oce. In some cases, however, a
person's job might come to de®ne him or her so well that the society de®nes them
by it. When this happens, what began as a discourse role might develop into a
societal role, as when a prominent medical doctor is identi®ed as such even when
he or she is picking up a head of lettuce at the supermarket.
Genre roles are speci®c to a particular genre within the discourse community.
For example, in this article, when we speak of the writer as a guide through the
essay or the architect of the essay, we are discussing genre roles, identities that are
created within the genre of the undergraduate academic essay or academic
research article. A genre role will generally not develop into a societal role. One
does not identify a person as a guide through the essay in any context outside of
academic writing. It is important to note that identities at all three levels can be
created linguistically in writing.
Taking up Cherry's (1988) challenge for more writing researchers to investigate
the phenomenon of self-representation in writing, Ivanic (1994, 1995, 1998) has
developed a well-articulated framework comprising four interrelated aspects of
writer identity (Table 1).
Ivanic's work is particularly revealing with respect to the discoursal (or textual )
selves of her participants (not to be confused with what we have called `discourse
roles'). In exploring the textual selves of her participants, she focuses on their
societal and discourse roles, but not genre roles. Our present study, therefore,
addresses genre roles, focusing only on one genre, namely the academic essay.

3. Possible identities behind the ®rst person pronoun in academic writing
In this section, we look at the various ways in which the ®rst person pronoun
may be used in academic writing. Most of us are probably aware at some level,
that not all instances of the authorial `I' are exactly alike, though few researchers
have articulated this explicitly. When we conducted a brief survey of handbooks
for college and university writers, we found that while many do address the
question of whether the ®rst person should be used in writing student essays, few
seem to appreciate the fact that the ®rst person pronoun in academic writing is
not a homogeneous entity, and that there is a range of roles or identities that may
be fronted by a ®rst person pronoun.
We took as our starting point a comment made by Ivanic (1998, p. 307): `[t]here
is a continuum from not using `I' at all, through using `I' with verbs associated
with the process of structuring the writing, to using `I' in association with the
research process, and ®nally to using `I' with verbs associated with cognitive acts'.
Ivanic does not expand on her idea of a continuum of `I's, nor does she state
explicitly the criteria by which she has ordered the ®rst person pronouns along
this continuum. However, it seems reasonable to suggest, given her past research
(see especially Ivanic, 1995), that what she had in mind was a cline showing the
degree of power wielded by the authorial presence through a particular instance of
use of the ®rst person pronoun.
Here,
therefore,
we
develop
Ivanic's
idea
of
a continuum
of `I's,
®rst
introducing the various roles that we have identi®ed for the ®rst person pronouns
within academic essays, and next ordering these roles along a continuum in terms
of the degree of authorial power. By a powerful authorial presence, we mean that
the writer displays a high level of authority within the text, where `authority' has
elements of both its common meanings of `a right to control or command others'
and `knowledge or expertise in a particular ®eld', as well as a meaning more
speci®c to this articleÐthe quality belonging to an `author', where `author' is used
in Ivanic's (1994, p. 12) very specialized sense of `a maker of meaning'.
Our setting up of the categories involved a preliminary analysis of our 27
student essays, and a sampling of published academic articles and books in
linguistics to determine the dierent identities foregrounded by the ®rst person

pronouns.
It
should be
noted
that
we
labelled
our
categories
`I'
as
the
representative, `I' as the guide, etc. for the sake of uniformity and ease of
reference. When we devised our continuum of roles, we considered all the various
forms of the ®rst person pronoun (I, me, my, mine, we, us, our, and ours ).
3.1. `I' as the representative
This is a generic ®rst person pronoun, usually realized as the plural we or us,
that writers use as a proxy for a larger group of people. For instance, in the
sentence It resulted in the English we know today (Script 10), `we' refers to people
in general. In a sentence like At least for French, we know that it solely belongs to
the Romance languages (Script 10), however, the `we' refers to a smaller group,
members of the linguistics discourse community perhaps. In the following
sentence, The English language that we have today re¯ects many centuries of
development (Script 16), it is especially clear that what appears to signal
ownership of some universal or common property (in this case `English') in reality
simply denotes the existence of a particular state of aairs. Thus, a noun phrase
like the English language that we have today simply means the English language
that exists today. Used this way, the ®rst person pronoun, far from giving the
reader information about the writer, eectively reduces the writer to a non-entity.
Therefore, in terms of the potential power wielded by an authorial presence, this
is the least powerful role that the ®rst person pronoun can front. [More examples
of the ®rst person pronoun used in this and the other roles are provided in the
appendix.]
3.2. `I' as the guide through the essay
The best way to understand this role is to think of the essay as a foreign
country, with the writer as the guide during the reader's journey through that
unfamiliar territory. With this overriding metaphor of `Essay=Foreign Country'
in place, we can see the role of guide being the person who shows the reader
through the essay (much as a tour director would take a traveller through a
foreign country), locates the reader and the writer together in the time and place
of the essay, draws the reader's attention to points which are plainly visible or
obvious within the essay (usually from examples that are cited within the text
itself), and arrives at a conclusion (destination) that he or she presumes is shared
by the reader. This particular role is often signalled explicitly by the use of verbs
like see, note, and observe (in Halliday's (1994) terms, mental processes of
perception, speci®cally visual perception), as in the following examples:
Let us now look at some examples of J[amaican] C[reole] compared to
Standard British English (SBE) (Script 26).
Moreover, from example 1, we observed that there is an absence of the
determiner article, `the' and pronoun, `that' (Script 26).
R. Tang, S. John / English for Speci®c Purposes 18 (1999) S23±S39
S27


## Page 6

It should be clear from this discussion that since the writer as guide is always
implicitly or explicitly accompanied by the reader, this particular usage of the ®rst
person pronoun is usually realized in the plural, inclusive form of we or us.
3.3. `I' as the architect of the essay
Usually realized as the ®rst person singular, this usage of the I foregrounds the
person who writes, organizes, structures, and outlines the material in the essay, as
in the following example:
In this essay, I will discuss the bastard status of English from the pre-English
period (-AD 450) to Middle English (c. 1100±1450) (Script 16).
Some might argue that the role of the architect exhibits similarities to that of
the guide. We agree that this is so, but we also believe that there is a crucial
dierence
between the
two. Where
the
architect has the
responsibility
of
organizing and outlining the material in the writing (creating structure, as it were,
in the writing process), there is a sense in which the guide merely seems to be
showing the reader through an already existing terrain. Given that the former
appears to be the more powerful role of the two, we think it best to maintain two
separate categories.
3.4. `I' as the recounter of the research process
The person behind this ®rst person pronoun is the one who describes or
recounts the various steps of the research process. This work done by the writer
prior to the writing might include such things as reading source texts, interviewing
subjects, collecting data and so on. This particular role is often signalled by the
pairing of ®rst person pronouns with what Halliday (1994) calls material process
verbs (i.e. `doing' verbs like work, read, interview, collect ), frequently used in the
past tense. A good example would be when Ivanic (1998, p. 118) writes `The data
I collected included written texts, transcripts of discussions and notes made as a
result of observation'.
3.5. `I' as the opinion-holder
The `opinion-holder' is the person who shares an opinion, view or attitude (for
example, by expressing agreement, disagreement or interest) with regard to known
information or established facts. While not always signalled by the use of `I', this
role when it does involve the use of the ®rst person pronoun, often co-occurs with
verbs depicting what Halliday (1994) terms mental processes of cognition, as in I
think Kushwant Singh has managed to succinctly convey the essence of the English
Language with his phrase `bastard language' (Script 8).

S28


## Page 7

3.6. `I' as the originator
This role, we suggest, is the most powerful role that a writer can create and
inhabit within his or her writing. It involves the writer's conception of the ideas or
knowledge claims which are advanced in the essay. Crucially, it calls for the writer
to present or signal these as new in the essay. It maps largely onto Ivanic's term
`author', the self that `claim[s] authority as the source of the content of the text'
(1998, p. 26). We like this particular quote from Ivanic, as it highlights an
important point with respect to this roleÐwhat is important is that the writers
`claim authority' and exhibit some form of ownership of the content of their
writing, showing that they perceive themselves as people who have the right and
the ability to originate new ideas, even if, at present, time constraints or
inexperience might make truly original contributions unlikely.
Having described in detail the six possible roles we have identi®ed behind the
®rst person pronoun, we now order these along a continuum (Fig. 1).
In the next part of our article, we report on our application of this continuum
to a speci®c examination of a sample of undergraduate academic essays.
4. Our study
We collected the essays written by 27 students for a ®rst-year English Language
module, EL1102 Studying English in Context. Students were required to complete
a 1000-word essay, explaining a given quotation using material taught on the
course. The question read: `English quite obviously is the richest language in the
world today because it has never succumbed to the purist like the French have
puristsÐthey're the worst enemies of language. English is a bastard language.
That's why it's virile. It's healthy. It's absorbed every language that it has come
into contact with.' (Kushwant Singh, Indian writer and former newspaper editor,
Fig. 1. A typology of possible identities behind the ®rst person pronoun in academic writing.

in a radio programme.) What does Kushwant Singh mean when he describes the
English language as a `bastard language'? You may focus on any aspect of its
`bastard' status (e.g. just one period of history, or just lexis or grammar) and
show this has aected the language.
We had two central concerns in looking at the essays: (1) to determine if the
students use ®rst person pronouns in their writing; and (2) to ascertain the roles
that are behind these ®rst person references. The main ®ndings of our research are
highlighted below.
Table 2 shows the distribution of the various ®rst person pronouns (fronting the
six roles we identi®ed) in each of the 27 essays.
We found that a fairly large percentage of our students (approximately 81%) do
use the ®rst person pronoun in their writing, though somewhat sparingly. The
average number of ®rst person pronouns per script is just 3.41. In terms of actual
numbers, there was one script with 16 occurrences of the ®rst person pronoun (the
highest number), and ®ve scripts with no instances of ®rst person pronoun use at
all.
5. Discussion
5.1. Representative
Out of a total of 92 instances of the ®rst person pronoun used (across all 27
scripts), 39 fall into this category. This translates into 42.39% of the total number
of occurrences, the highest percentage taken up by a single role.
This role, as we have highlighted, is the least powerful role our students inhabit
in their writing. Clark, Cottey, Constantinou and Yeoh (1990, p. 91) write that
`students are in a position of weakness relative to those who assess their work'. It
is not surprising then that some students, feeling that they do not have a right to
exist in academic writing, adopt a role which carries the least information about
themselves as individuals. For example when a student writes Ranges of languages
have come together over the centuries to produce now what we call the English
Language (Script 12), the `we' in the sentence says nothing speci®c about the
writer but makes a rather vague reference to `people' in general.
It is possible, however, to see a positive side to this role. When our students
inhabit the role as representative, it may be an attempt on their part to signal
their (desired) membership in the linguistics discourse community. This is seen
when they display knowledge of the facts and opinions that are generally accepted
by other members of this discourse community. Therefore, when a student writes
Thus we get an in¯ection of the noun that we have today (Script 12), or Besides the
lexis, hypotaxis in our grammar was also adapted from Latin (Script 6), these
sentences indicate shared knowledge between the writer and the reader, and a
presupposition of the writer's acceptance in the linguistics discourse community.
As Ivanic (1995, p. 15) points out, `[w]hen someone uses a particular discourse
R. Tang, S. John / English for Speci®c Purposes 18 (1999) S23±S39
S30


## Page 9

type, they identify themselves with the interests, values, beliefs and power relations
which are associated with it'. She also suggests that students create the impression
that they are members of the discourse community because they assume it will
`bring [them] good grades'.
Although students' alignment of themselves with established members of the
discourse community should be viewed as positive, we suggest that, in comparison
to the other roles along our continuum, the representative is not a very
demanding role. Unlike the architect who creates structure for the text, the
recounter of research who relates steps in the research process (thus recreating the
backdrop to the research), and the opinion-holder and originator who formulate
thoughts and ideas in the writing (creating the `content' as it were), the

representative merely positions himself or herself alongside other creators of
meaning rather than doing any actual creation at all. Therefore, although we have
a high number of instances of the ®rst person pronoun in this category, it does
not point to a strong authorial presence.
5.2. Guide
There are 31 instances of the ®rst person pronoun used in conjunction with this
role. This accounts for 33.7% of the total, again a fairly high percentage. One
striking similarity between this role and the role of the representative is that the
role of guide, too, is realized by the plural form of the ®rst person. (There are 29
instances of we and two of us used in conjunction with this role.) This tendency of
students to signal their presence in their texts with the plural person is signi®cant,
as it suggests that students may be operating with a `safety in numbers' mentality,
and that they are reluctant to assert their individuality in their writing.
Another possible reason for students' apparent con®dence with this role is that
it is, in a sense, an `external' role. Although written in at the time of composing,
the guide seems in some essays to be a rather ¯eeting presence, surfacing only at
strategic moments in the essay to lead the reader through the text. Further, as a
guide, the writer appears to momentarily stand apart from the writing he or she is
otherwise creating to view the direction that the text is taking, and to show the
reader this direction, almost as if the text were an entity unrelated to him or her.
The guide, thus, is a fairly non-threatening role to inhabit, as it allows students
to provide direction in their writing while remaining fairly distant from it. In
addition, the writer as guide presupposes the congenial accompaniment of the
reader and backgrounds the `author' of the ideas (who might be the subject of
attacks from discerning readers).
5.3. Architect
In our students' scripts, we found only 13 instances of the ®rst person pronoun
in the role of the architect. This low occurrence was somewhat disturbing as the
architect's duty is to signpost and provide an overall outline of the essay for the
reader, a very important feature in good writing. Returning to the scripts,
however, we discovered that students are in fact present as architects of their
writing, but do not use the ®rst person to realise this role. Instead, students use
one or more of three other strategies:
1. Passivisation, which allows students to remove themselves as the agent of any
actions performed (e.g. the action of showing in the example below):
The sources of the English lexis will be shown and in reality, the English
language has been aected in an enriching fashion (Script 13).
R. Tang, S. John / English for Speci®c Purposes 18 (1999) S23±S39
S32


## Page 11

2. Making an inanimate object (e.g. this essay ) the agent of the actions
performed:
This essay looks at the variation and development of English lexisÐone aspect
of its `bastard' status (Script 11).
3. Nominalisation, whereby an action done by the writers (discuss in the
example below) is turned into an abstract noun which is then portrayed as the
agent of another action (explain in the example below):
A discussion on lexis can explain the `bastard' status of the English language
(Script 24).
If it is true that the social meanings language carries with it are `embodied in
. . . lexical and syntactic structures', as Fowler et al. (1979, cited in Clark, 1992, p.
121) suggest, then students by making other lexical and syntactic choices instead
of using the ®rst person pronoun reveal something important about the way in
which they perceive themselves at the university and in their writing. Their notion
that academic writing is necessarily distant and impersonal may in fact be part of
a higher overriding `ideolog[y] of knowledge making' (Ivanic, 1998, p. 303). Ivanic
(1998) refers to a continuum from a constructivist view to a positivist view of
knowledge-making in academia. Table 3 summarizes the dierences between these
two views.
Given that our students seem to `objectify' knowledge, one goal of writing
education then should be to make students aware that there is an alternative to
this positivist view of meaning, while still leaving to them the ultimate decision of

5.4. Recounter of the research process
None of our students used ®rst person pronouns in conjunction with this role in
their essays. This is perhaps not surprising, given the nature of the task that was

set for them. The assignment called for students to evaluate a quotation using
course material to which they had access. Apart from reading, students were not
required to engage in other activities that might be necessary with a larger scale
research project, such as collection of data, interviewing of subjects, and so on.
Our survey of academic literature reveals that this role is prevalent when the
writer has conducted an experiment or study of some sort, and wishes to detail
the various steps undertaken during the course of research. This element was
absent in the task assigned to the students in this study. The question that we
cannot answer is whether or not our students would have exhibited this role of
recounter if this element had not been absent, and would they have then fronted
this role explicitly with the ®rst person, or realized it in some other way?
5.5. Opinion-holder and originator
We discuss these two roles together because we have noted that there is often a
natural progression from the role of opinion-holder (expressing an opinion of
someone else's views) to the role of originator (venturing one's own take on an
issue) in mature academic writing.
In our sample, we found that students do use the ®rst person to front both
these roles, though in relatively small numbers. Out of 92 instances of the ®rst
person, only four (4.49%) fall into the opinion-holder category, and ®ve (5.61%)
into the original category.
This low occurrence could stem from the fact that these are fairly demanding
roles, requiring writers to be accountable for the propositions raised. Using the
®rst person pronoun for these roles is arguably even more daunting, as it means
explicitly bringing the writer-as-thinker into the writing, exposing their thoughts to
the scrutiny of the reader. Peritz (1993, p. 380) notes that:
Normally, my students read texts as though they were instructive collections of
authoritative information. Small wonder, then, that they also tend to think of
published writers as authorities who know it all and of their own academic
writing as little more than a report of what such authoritative others already
know.
For students to originate their own ideas and opinions might appear to them to
involve aligning themselves with textbook writers and lecturers in terms of their
right to be `authors'. It means exposing their original views to such `authoritative
others' as their tutors and lecturers for evaluation. This is understandably an
intimidating process, and it is possible that students feel insecure about the
validity of their claims, seeing themselves to be at one of the lowest rungs of the
academic ladder.
Given that the ®rst person is used so infrequently in conjunction with the roles
of opinion-holder and originator, a useful area for future research would be how
our students realize these roles in other ways. As Kirsch (1993, p. 64) says,

`Creating a distance from one's textÐdenying ownershipÐis one mechanism for
coping with inhibiting audiences'. It is possible therefore that the picture is not as
bleak as it appears, and that students do actually venture opinions and originate
ideas, hiding behind a cloak of passivisation and seeming `objectivity', instead of
overtly signalling their presence with the ®rst person (c.f. architect role ®ndings).
In addition, we feel it is important to recognise that it is the student's
perception of their right and ability to be originators that is crucial. For example,
we at times ®nd that students create certain positive expectations in their readers
by signalling their intention to prove or examine a proposition. These are verbs
with
a

of

and

will
understandably be disappointed if the students then fail to ful®l those expectations
by merely presenting material, with no attempt at evaluation or argumentation.
Where some might view this entirely negatively, we suggest that there might be a
positive angle to this occurrence. Although certainly not ideal, it suggests that
students see themselves in this powerful position, and their perception of their
right to inhabit this role could be a ®rst step to fully and legitimately following
through with a role they have introduced.
6. Concluding remarks and pedagogical implications
We have explored the dierent kinds of identities that students can bring into
their writing when they use the ®rst person pronoun. In addition, we have
highlighted some of the diculties students face when they enter the academic
discourse community of the university. In this ®nal section, we make use of the
insights introduced in this article to oer some perspectives on writing education
in the university classroom.
Our study has shown the wide-ranging nature of the identities that the ®rst
person pronoun can front. Taking care not to veer into a new kind of
prescriptivism, we suggest that it is vital for students and teachers alike to be
aware of the very real presence of these dierent ways in which the ®rst person
pronoun can be used in academic writing. For students, an understanding of the
choices available to them may help them decide how best to present themselves in
their writing. At present some students may be avoiding the use of the ®rst person
simply because of some vague preconceived notion that academic writing should
be distant and impersonal. For teachers, the results of this study imply the need to
recognise that the question is not simply whether or not the ®rst person pronoun
should be allowed or encouraged in academic writing. Rather, the issue becomes
which speci®c type of the ®rst person pronoun, if any, writers should use, when,
and for what purpose. This may also involve recognising that the writer in a text
is seen less in the presence versus the absence of ®rst person pronouns per se than
in the presence of certain types of ®rst person pronouns.
We believe that any writing education programme at the university should
include issues of writer identity, and draw the attention of students to the fact

that their language choices re¯ect who they are in their writing. This focus on
critical language awareness seeks to empower students such that they are no longer
`naively manipulated by [conventions]' (Clark, 1992, p. 118), thus paving the way
for their emancipation, when students `us[e] the power gained through awareness
to act' (Clark, 1992, p. 119). This conversion of what could be at present
`subconscious' choices into conscious, well-informed decisions in their writing is a
®rst step to creating con®dent writers with a good sense of themselves. The
responsibility of making these options known to the students lies with eective
writing education programmes that encourage students to be critical thinkers and
writers, people who are able and eager to create the meaning that they want to
create, and the self that they want to present in their writing.

Appendix
A1.1. More examples for each category from student scripts and published academic
articles
`I' as the representative
. The dierentiation of British and American English causes us to ponder about
the right form of Standard English (Script 2).
. In the ecclesiastical sphere, we have words like abbot, bishop, martyr, psalter
and so forth (Script 13).
. We know that all dialects of English, whether standard or non-standard, are
capable of conveying complex thought (Bizzell, 1992).
`I' as the guide
. As we examine the various classes of loan words from French, we can see the
dierent ways French civilisation and culture has in¯uenced English (Script 12).
. In example 1 we see the tendency for SAE to form interrogative constructions
without changing the position of the subject `you' and auxiliary items `would'
(Script 26).
. So far we have said nothing about the `senses' of words, mentioned in point 4
of the Proposal (Graddol, Leith & Swann, 1996).
`I' as the architect
. I will concentrate on the period Renaissance and its in¯uence on the English
language (Script 6).

. In my essay, I shall look into the contributions made by the dierent languages
to the lexis of the English language (Script 17).
. In the next four sections of the paper I1 explain what I mean by each of these
issues in more detail, giving examples from the experience of my nine co-
researchers (Ivanic, 1995).
`I' as the recounter of the research process
. All of the papers I read were built around one of three commonplaces: (1)
creativity is self-expression; (2) creativity is doing something new or unique; and
(3) creativity is using old things in new ways (Bartholomae, 1985).
. I tape recorded a conversation with each co-researcher about the role of literacy
in their lives, past and present (Ivanic, 1998).
. Although I discuss only three students in this essay, my information about them
is drawn from a two year period, when I interviewed eight seniors, four each a
year, on a weekly basis (Chase, 1988).
`I' as the opinion-holder
. Looking back at Kushwant Singh's words, we can determine from this period
that English did indeed absorb the languages it came into contact with (Script
2).
. Secondly, I would like to show that, contrary to what Kushwant believes,2 the
development of English is not merely because that it is part of an upward
evolution. That would be an over-simpli®cation. Rather, the development of
English is better evaluated as a history of changes (Script 27).
. I agree with Fairclough (1992b) that cross-disciplinary theory and research on
the way in which discourse functions in society needs more sophisticated
linguistic and intertextual analysis to show more precisely how discourse
constructs identity (Ivanic, 1998).
`I' as the originator
. Hence, I will examine the factors contributing to the rise of and continued
dominance and variety in the modern world, with the understanding that the
meaning of Kushwant Singh's description can only be fully appreciated within
these parameters3 (Script 4).
. To me the phrase embodies the whole evolution process of the language to its
present day status (Script 8).
. Part of the impetus here is, as I see it, to place writing in a larger context and
1 Where more than one ®rst person pronoun occurs within a single example, the pronoun relevant to
the role is the one underlined.
2 This italicised portion helped us decide that the writer is inhabiting the role of the opinion-holder,
although the rest of the sentence and the subsequent two sentences indicate that there are elements of
the originator identity present as well.
3 Although there are hints of the architect role in this example, we feel the italicised portion tips the
balance in favour of the originator identity.

to highlight it as a social activity (Chase, 1988).
. My idea rested on the assumption that at each of these stages students face
dierent problems, and that their successes in solving these problems need to be
measured separately if they are to develop as writers (Lynch, 1982).
