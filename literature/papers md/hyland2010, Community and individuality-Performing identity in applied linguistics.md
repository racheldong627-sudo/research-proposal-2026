Community and 
Individuality: Performing 
Identity in Applied 
Linguistics
Ken Hyland1
Abstract
Recent research has emphasized the close connections between writing 
and the construction of an author’s identity. While academic contexts 
privilege certain ways of making meanings and so restrict what resources 
participants can bring from their past experiences, we can also see these 
writing conventions as a repertoire of options that allow writers to actively 
and publicly accomplish an identity through discourse choices. This article 
takes a somewhat novel approach to the issue of authorial identity by 
using the tools of corpus analysis to examine the published works of two 
leading figures in applied linguistics: John Swales and Debbie Cameron. By 
comparing high frequency keywords and clusters in their writing with a 
larger applied linguistics reference corpus, I attempt to show how corpus 
techniques might inform our study of identity construction and something 
of the ways identity can be seen as independent creativity shaped by an 
accountability to shared practices.

The relationship between language and identity has long been a major area of 
sociolinguistic investigation and has become particularly important over the 
last decade as identity has come to be seen as something that we actively and 
publicly accomplish in our interactions with each other (e.g., Benwell & 
Stokoe, 2006). Identity is a person’s relationship to his or her social world, 
a joint, two-way production and language allows us to create and present a 
coherent self to others because it ties us into webs of commonsense, interests, 
and shared meanings. Who we are and who we might be are built up through 
participation and linked to situations, to relationships, and to the rhetorical 
strategies and positions we adopt in engaging with others on a routine basis. 
This means that it is through our use of community discourses that we claim 
or resist membership of social groups to define who we are in relation to 
others. Identity therefore helps characterize both what makes us similar to 
and different from each other and, for academics, it is how they achieve 
credibility as insiders and reputations as individuals.
Negotiating a representation of self from the standardizing conventions of 
disciplinary discourses is clearly a skilled accomplishment for individuals 
involving both recognizing and exploiting community constraints. However, 
it is also a challenge for analysts. To take seriously the idea that identity 
is formed through discourse, we need a means of getting at the ways individu-
als routinely assemble markers of “who they are” through interaction. In this 
article I propose a novel method of exploring authorial identity as an aspect 
of discourse performance using corpus linguistic methods. By interrogating 
the published works of two leading figures in applied linguistics, John Swales 
and Deborah Cameron, and comparing these texts with mainstream work in 
the field, I seek to show how writers manage the tension between shared 
norms and individual traits. The research suggests how personal proclivities 
can contribute to an independent creativity shaped by shared practices and 
advances a methodology for uncovering this.
Identity: Individuality and Disciplinarity in Writing
Research on academic writing has long stressed the connection between 
writing and the creation of an author’s identity (Hatch, Hill, & Hayes, 1993; 
Ivanic, 1998). Identity is said to be implicated in the texts we engage in and 
the linguistic choices we make, thus relocating it from the private to the 
public sphere and from hidden processes of cognition to its social and 
dynamic construction in discourse. Issues of agency and conformity, stability 
and change, remain controversial, however. Some writers question whether 
there is an absolute, unchanging self lurking behind such discourse and 
suggest that identity is a performance ( e.g., Butler, 1990), while others see

identity as the product of dominant discourses tied to institutional practices 
(Foucault, 1972). I want to suggest, however, that regular patterns of lan-
guage choices help individuals to realize coherent and relatively consistent 
identities. Almost everything we say or write, in fact, says something about 
us and the kind of relationship we want to establish with our interactants. 
Our identities are only successful to the extent that they are recognized by 
others however, and this means employing, appropriating, and transforming 
existing discourses (Bakhtin, 1986).
For Bakhtin, all writing is produced in relation to previous texts and as 
writers draw on these discourses they textually construct social identities in 
the sense of representing themselves in alignment, or dissonance, with those 
discourses. In any context, one discourse is likely to be dominant and hence 
more visible, so that writers often consciously or unconsciously take up 
the identity options this privileged discourse makes available (Wertsch, 1991). 
This means that powerful discourses, such as those authorized by academic 
disciplines, act to restrict the rhetorical resources participants can bring from 
their past experiences and constrain what they might take from those made 
available by the context. Such discourses, of course, exhibit a certain stability 
and power; after all, they are the principal means by which disciplines produce, 
assess, and authorize knowledge, train neophytes, distinguish members, and 
legitimate their authority in the world.
Adopting a voice associated with a particular field of study thus involves 
aligning ourselves with its knowledge-making practices and these tend to 
exclude the performance of certain identities and favor identities that imply an 
autonomous, asocial, and impersonal observer (e.g., Ivanic & Simpson, 1992). 
Foucault (1972) is pessimistic in his emphasis on regulation and denial of 
agency in this regard, but while actors are positioned in terms of what disci-
plinary Discourses allow, they also position themselves in terms of personal 
stance and interpersonal alignments. Essentially, the requirements of academic 
conventions do not form a closed and determining system but can be seen as 
a pattern of options that allows writers to actively and publicly accomplish an 
identity through discourse choices, as Fairclough (1992) observes,
Subjects are ideologically positioned, but they are also capable of acting 
creatively to make their own connections between the diverse practices 
and ideologies to which they are exposed, and to restructure positioning 
practices and structures. (p. 91)
There is, in other words, always potential for transformation as well as 
reproduction in academic discourses. Bakhtin (1986), for example, talks of a 
process of “becoming” as we develop an awareness of our tacit choices and

habits of meaning making to gain control over our projections of self in 
writing. We draw on a repertoire of voices as we write, bringing to the task 
our own experiences, purposes, and conceptions of self to recombine the 
options offered by the genre we are writing in to perform a professional 
identity. Our diverse experiences and memberships, including those of 
class, ethnicity, and gender, influence how we understand our disciplinary 
participation and how we interact with our colleagues in the performance of 
this academic identity. So while the production of texts is always the 
production of self, individual agency is not eliminated by the cultural 
authority of convention and the editing of disciplinary gatekeepers. Precisely 
how we unpick this tangle of influences remains unclear, however, but corpus 
methods offer a way forward.
Bringing Corpora to Identity Studies
Identity research is an area largely characterized by autobiographical methods, 
where discourse helps construct an identity through the ways that people 
explain and understand their lives (e.g., de Fina, Schiffrin, & Bamberg, 2006). 
But while this approach is profoundly social and emphasizes the continual 
interpretation and reinterpretation of experience through a cultural lens, narra-
tive can only ever be a partial representation of who we are. It is a one-sided 
self-construction that underplays the fact that our interpretations must accord 
with the narratives of others and with the facts of actual events: we cannot 
claim to be whatever and whoever we want (Lawler, 2008). More directly, 
narrative is a self-conscious and reflective assembling of experience for the 
purpose of constructing an identity, usually for a researcher, in a relatively 
formal and contrived context. Most of the time, however, we are not perform-
ing identity work by narrating stories of ourselves but claiming identities 
while engaged in doing something else. If identity is really a performance 
and not simply an interpretive recounting then we need to find ways of captur-
ing what people routinely do with language that is similar or different from 
what others do with it. Corpus studies help provide us with this.
The value of a corpus approach is that it provides evidence for how 
language is used by particular authors and so how individuals construct an 
identity through consistent patterns of rhetorical choices. Corpus analysis is 
a method based on the idea that the study of a collection of related texts can 
illuminate our understanding of the contexts and events those texts help 
create. In other words, it attempts to reveal interaction in a particular 
domain as a collection of rhetorical choices rather than as specific acts of 
writing. Its advantage for identity research is that it goes beyond claims made 
in interviews or decisions made on particular occasions of writing to explore

the regularity and repetition of what is socially ratified and independently 
variant and therefore what represents preferred practices by both individuals 
and collectivities.
Corpus analysis is, however, a method more commonly used to describe 
genres, rhetorical practices, and form–function relationships (e.g., Hyland, 
2004) than to explore issues of identity. Increasingly though, corpora are 
opening new vistas of research in stylistics and authorship studies, where 
they have helped to discover what is distinctive about a particular author’s 
work (e.g., Holmes, 1994; Semino & Short, 2004). Recently, corpora have 
also been used in forensic investigations to settle legal cases of disputed 
authorship (e.g., Olsson, 2004) or for profiling writers according to sets of 
sociolinguistic attributes such as gender (Koppel, Argamon, & Shimoni, 
2002), language background (Vel, Corney, Anderson, & Mohay, 2002), and 
education level (Juola & Baayen, 2005).
This work recognizes the plausibility of identifying a “stylistic profile” or 
“linguistic fingerprint” (Hanlein, 1998) from the consistent patterns of choices 
authors make, so that if choice is constant then it is seen as an individual style 
marker. In other words, by “dematerializing texts” away from actual concrete 
instances a corpus approach has the potential to offer linguistic evidence of 
consistent rhetorical patterning rather than author impressions. Uncovering 
the regularities in frequency and patterning of words, senses and phraseology 
can therefore help identify authorial preferences and how writers seek to posi-
tion themselves with their readers and so project a possible identity. The 
following sections explore how this works through the published research of 
two applied linguists: Deborah Cameron and John Swales.
The Protagonists
I selected these two academics largely because their highly distinctive 
rhetorical styles offers a good starting point for this kind of analysis. They are 
also interesting because of their profiles and the fact they are likely to be known 
to readers of this journal. Both enjoy considerable disciplinary celebrity and 
are among the foremost researchers in their fields, holding professorships at 
leading research universities either side of the Atlantic, Cameron at Oxford 
and Swales at Michigan, with substantial research and writing careers. Deborah 
Cameron is a sociolinguist known most widely for her work on gender, glo-
balization and language, and discourse in the workplace while John Swales 
is the doyen of the ESP movement and the most influential champion of 
genre in English language teaching and research. It should be mentioned 
that both authors encouraged this project and offered their comments on this 
article.

These writers are very different from each other in terms of experience 
and philosophy. Cameron is a committed left winger and active feminist from 
a working class background, while Swales had a conventional middle class 
upbringing. Both, however, are mavericks and didn’t tread the traditional 
academic career path. Cameron left school at 17 doing low-paid, drudge jobs 
before going to university and starting her career relatively late, while Swales 
was a peripatetic English teacher wandering through Europe and Africa 
before taking a senior lectureship at Aston and finally settling in the United 
States. Neither went through conventional PhD training and both came to 
prominence on the basis of an early, highly influential, publication in a new 
field: Feminism and Linguistic Theory (Cameron, 1992) and Genre Analysis 
(Swales, 1990). Unusually in applied linguistics, both have continued to be 
more heavily cited for their books rather than articles and both experiment 
with nonacademic genres: Swales with textbooks and autobiography 
(e.g., Swales, 2009; Swales & Feak, 2004) and Cameron with polemics and 
popularizations (e.g., Cameron, 2006a) as a high-profile commentator in 
both print and broadcast media.
Perhaps most importantly, both are intensely self aware rhetoricians 
who have published on discourse analysis and grammar, and both are 
known for their accessibility. Cameron’s books Verbal Hygiene (1995) and 
Good To Talk? (2000), both dealing in different ways with contemporary 
normative practices of regulating communication, and her collection of 
articles On Language and Sexual Politics (2006b), are very readable and 
have enjoyed success across a range of fields. Similarly, the popularity of 
Swales monographs Other Floors, Other Voices (1998) and Research 
Genres (2004) is partly due to their reader friendliness. Swales has edited a 
journal and both have edited important collections of research and regu-
larly review others’ writing. It is this rhetorical reflexivity, and the confidence 
to deploy it, which was decisive in selecting these writers for analysis. This 
apparent willingness to stray from disciplinary norms to locally manage a 
discoursal identity makes them ideal case studies for a fruitful analysis of 
variation.
Texts and Method
The main investigative technique here is comparison. Comparing the features 
of target writers’ texts with a much large reference corpus of work in the 
same discipline can help to determine what is general in the norms of a com-
munity and what represents more personal choices. Stubbs (2005) puts it 
like this:

Individual texts can be explained only against a background of what is 
normal and expected in general language use, and this is precisely the 
comparative information that quantitative corpus data can provide. An 
understanding of the background of the usual and everyday—what hap-
pens millions of times—is necessary in order to understand the unique.
Extending this principle beyond individual texts, we can see that if a par­
ticular word, phrase, or usage is common in a corpus of a particular writer’s 
work, then it might be said to be a consistent preference that reveals some­
thing of that individual’s routine expression of self: of a relatively unreflective 
performance of identity.
The corpora used here represent a considerable proportion of each writer’s 
single authored output over their careers (See appendix). My corpus of Cam-
eron’s published writing consists of 21 single authored articles made available 
by the author. It represents some 20 years of publishing and comprises 
125,000 words. The Swales corpus was compiled at the Michigan ELI and 
provided with his approval. It consists of 14 single-authored articles together 
with the bulk of his three monographs, representing 18 years of output and 
comprising 342,000 words. These corpora were individually compared with 
a larger reference corpus representing a spectrum of current published work 
in applied linguistics and in the same genres as the target texts. It comprises 
75 research articles from 20 leading international journals and 25 chapters 
from 12 books totaling 750,000 words.
I used Wordsmith Tools Version 4 (Scott, 2004) to generate word lists of 
the most frequent single words, and three- and four-word strings for each of 
the target authors and for the reference corpus. These strings, which Biber, 
Johansson, Leech, Conrad, and Finegan (1999) call lexical bundles and 
Scott (2004) clusters, are words that follow each other more frequently than 
expected by chance and so contribute to our sense of distinctiveness in a 
register. Particular bundles tend to differ according to discipline and genre 
(e.g., Hyland, 2008), but it seemed worth exploring ideolect variation.
I then compared each author corpus with the reference corpus using the 
KeyWords tool. This program identifies words and phrases that occur signifi-
cantly more frequently in the smaller corpus than the larger one using a 
log-likelihood statistic. This offers a better characterization of the differences 
between two corpora than a simple frequency comparison as it identifies 
items that are “key” differentiators across many files. That is, they are signifi-
cantly more or less frequent in the author texts rather than simply being the 
most used. In this way, I could identify which words best distinguish the 
texts of these authors from those in applied linguistics more generally as

represented in the reference corpus. After reviewing the keyword lists and 
identifying individual words and multiword clusters, I concordanced the more 
frequent items of group common devices into broad pragmatic categories to 
capture central aspects of their writing.
Personal Interests and Professional Niches
I first examined the high frequency content words and keywords in these 
texts to discover how far the respective research fields of these authors 
threw up a specific lexis. Academics construct whatever status they manage 
to achieve by advancing knowledge, and in a field marked by considerable 
competition for space, this is an imperative that requires precise contribu-
tions. As a result, and over time, academics carve a niche of expertise from 
the mass of disciplinary subject matter, creating a specialization that forms 
the basis of their career and reputation. High frequency items therefore 
reflect the key themes of an individual’s work and serve as motifs for their 
contribution to the field.
The most frequent content words in Cameron’s writing are women, 
language, gender, men, social, linguistic, talk, people, discourse, and work, 
all of which occur more than 200 times and in 90% of the articles in her 
corpus. These high frequency items clearly identify the terrain marked out 
and occupied by Cameron as her own. They indicate her concern with the 
ways language functions to structure social relations in diverse settings, 
particularly in work contexts and in the ways gender linked patterns of 
language use are made significant in social relations. Her studies of gender 
are acknowledged as pivotal in helping to undermine a binary model of 
gender to take account of intragender diversity, revealing both the ways 
gender is enacted locally and the institutional factors that operate to construct 
inequality. These observations are supported in her preferred multiword 
clusters, which are men and women (76 times), language and gender (74), 
and women and men (56).
The top eight content items from the larger Swales corpus are research, 
genre(s), English, discourse, language, academic, writing, and students. 
All these items occur over 500 times and, like texts, community, and rhetorical, 
which appear a little further down the list with over  300 occurrences and 
appear in 90% or more of the articles and chapters that make up the corpus. 
The most common multiword clusters are nonnative speakers of English, the 
concept of discourse community, a genre-based approach, and English as a 
second language. Again, these are the main areas by which we identify Swales 
as an individual academic, encompassing his work on genre, community, and 
his concern for international students using English as a foreign language.

More importantly than raw frequencies in this regard, however, is that of 
keywords, those that are most unusually frequent compared to a larger refer-
ence corpus. Table 1 summarizes the words and phrases that are far more 
typical of their work than those in the 725,000 word applied linguistics corpus 
(at p < .1 significance).
Keywords give a reasonably good idea about what a writer’s work is about 
and which best distinguish it within the discourses of the community. The 
analysis thus returns the nouns and noun phrases which characterize the 
research interests of these two academics. Some odd forms in the Swales’ list 
like herbarium, species, specimen, and the North University Building are 
attributable to his research into the lives and texts of those inhabiting a 
university building published as Other Floors, Other Voices. There are also 
some unexpected items in Cameron’s list. The gender genie, a Web site that 
supposedly predicts the gender of an author of a supplied text, for instance, is 
critiqued in several articles. The call centre also appears in several papers as 
an example of the technicization of communication: how the commonplace 
social activity of talk has been transformed into a technical skill and what this 
means in the production line contexts of service calls. Unlike the data for 
Swales, the most frequent 4-grams in her corpus simply added another word 
to the most common 3-grams, suggesting that she uses a more restricted 
range of common phrases.
Beyond these items, noncontent words and phrases emerge in the keywords 
lists as consistent individual choices. Rhetorical conventions obviously reflect 
the epistemological assumptions of a discipline and applied linguistics tends 
to be seen as a “soft-applied” field: functional, oriented to the improvement of 
practice, and employing explicitly interpretive, data-informed methods (Hyland, 
2004). But within these broad institutional practices individuals have recourse 
to different “interpretive repertoires,” or ways of constructing their versions 
of events, and in what follows I illustrate the potential of corpus methods to 
reveal what these can tell us about the creation of a disciplinary self.
Deborah Cameron—The Radical Linguist
Deborah Cameron has created, through her writing, a reputation as a radical 
linguist, challenging orthodox conceptions of workplace and gender discourse. 
Part of this impact is due to what is the most striking feature of her discourse: 
her willingness to engage in head-on debate with alternative positions, thus 
projecting a confident, combative identity. She does this, however, while 
simultaneously aligning herself with her disciplinary colleagues. In this section 
of the paper, I explore how she accomplishes this rhetorical identity through 
the ways she establishes claims, challenges others, and establishes solidarity.

Establishing Truths
Classification and identification are commonplace in academic discourse, 
but in Cameron’s writing they take on an assertive and confident quality. 
Wordsmith identified is as the fifth most Keyword in Cameron’s corpus, 
representing a significantly above average use. This is, of course, one of the 
most common words in English (Sinclair, 1999, p. 176) and in academic 
prose usually specifies a logical relationship between referents, typically 
with full noun phrase subjects (Biber et al., 1999, pp. 448-450). In Cameron’s 
work these are gender (62 times) and language (53), which are variously 
defined, described, and commented on, as here:
1.	
The term gender is used in this chapter primarily to refer to the 
social condition of being a man or a woman.
	
. . . gender is regulated and policed by rather rigid social norms.
	
. . . language is actually the symbolic arena in which some other 
ideological contest is being fought out.
More often, however, we find other collocational patterns with is in her 
writing. It is co-occurs most frequently (370 times) with a particularly high 
use of it is + adj. + to infinitive (161 times):
2.	
It is reasonable to suppose that a diner wouldn’t enquire about the 
existence of a particular foodstuff out of idle curiosity…
	
It is important to distinguish between the ideological representations 
of gender found in texts like conduct books and the actual practice 
of real historical gendered subjects.
	
It is difficult to think of any human occupation whose performance 
does not depend on some kind of knowledge.
Thematic it introducing an embedded clause as subject helps to shift new 
or complex information towards the end of a sentence, to the rheme, where 
it is easier for readers to process. It also, however, functions to assert the 
writer’s opinion and recruit the reader into it. But because it attempts 
explicitly to take control of readers’ thinking, it is a potentially threatening 
strategy in rhetorical terms and, as a result, carries a high risk of rejection. 
To pull it off, Cameron has to recognize a diversity of viewpoints and be 
prepared to engage with these. She therefore creates a sense of solidarity by 
“writing the reader into the text” through adjective choices which encourage 
the addressee to share the conviction she has in her views. Essentially,

however, she is willing to win them over to her position through the confident, 
unambiguous expression of her commitments.
This assertiveness in Cameron’s authorial positioning is also realized 
through other uses of the verb is. It also, for instance, occurs frequently in 
the company of that (230 times) which is itself among the most highly listed 
keywords in Cameron’s writing. A common use of this collocation in the 
corpus is to express what Hyland and Tse (2005) have called “evaluative 
that,” a grammatical structure in which a complement clause is embedded 
in a superordinate clause to project the writer’s attitudes or ideas. These 
examples are typical:
3.	
It is my own view that generalization remains a legitimate goal for 
social science . . .
	
What has not changed is my conviction that theoretical arguments 
about meaning are not just a side issue in debates on sexism in 
language.
	
In this context it is problematic that unmarked or generic occupa-
tional terms are also often masculine.
This is a powerful construction for expressing evaluative meanings in 
academic discourse as it allows the writer to thematize the evaluation, making 
the attitudinal meaning the starting point of the message and the perspective 
from which the content of the that clause is interpreted. While rarely employing 
a first person subject, Cameron nevertheless leaves us in no doubt of her attitude 
in these examples, fronting her statements with a strong personal evaluation.
Challenging Contrary Positions
Another way in which Cameron deploys the linguistic resources of the 
discipline to construct a distinctive identity is through the use of rebuttal and 
counterargument, with not (904 times), but (572), and though (144), all in the 
top 20 keywords. Once again this is a forceful and dialogistic means of 
engaging with others’ views, but instead of proclaiming a position it disputes 
alternatives.
Cameron employs negation far more than is common in applied linguistics, 
responding to possible viewpoints through direct challenge. This is a typical 
example:

that degree courses should be for the many and not just the few,

has attained the status of received wisdom, and it is hard to dis-
pute it without appearing snobbish, reactionary or simply out of 
date. What lies behind it is not, however, a desire to democratize 
the “life of the mind,” but a set of ideas about the changing nature 
of work.
Negation is thus a resource for introducing an alternative position into 
the dialogue in order to reject it. Here Cameron appears to concur with 
the apparently reasonable policies promoting wider university access for 
nontraditional groups, agreeing with the implied reader that such policies 
are positive and democratic. She then steps back to question the assumptions 
that arise from it, presenting her own position that “knowledge work” is better 
characterized as a skill acquired for the benefit of employers. The reader is 
not bludgeoned by her argument but construed as potentially vulnerable to 
a pervasive ideology, which she then disputes. So once again, Cameron 
shows she is sensitive to the addressee’s assumed beliefs and seeks to adjust 
these with her own decisive views.
This is also evident in cases where she counters a contrary position rather 
than negates it, mainly using the conjunctions but, though, and however. 
Like denials, these are dialogistic in that they acknowledge other voices 
only to dispute them. Often this is to contest a claim in the prior literature, 
as in this example where she discusses views on nonsexist language then 
offers a restrictive modification of this work:
5.	 Apart from their criticisms of it, Shortland and Fauvel seem 
curiously undecided as to whether nonsexist language makes any 
political difference. But once again, this entire discussion is locked 
into a framework dictated by false premises, for within the authors’ 
problematic the reformist’s rationale can only be determinism 
(change language and you change the world) or else accurately 
(change language and you reflect reality better).
Alternatively, the view which is countered does not originate in the 
disciplinary literature, but is regarded as more widespread and projected 
onto readers themselves. In (6), for example, Cameron raises the widely 
held view that norms of verbal effectiveness are now seen to be increasingly 
influenced by female values and practices. Following the countering 
conjunction, she observes that “communication skills” is a cultural construct, 
not a natural phenomenon and that it is unwise to routinely attribute certain 
verbal skills to women while denying them to men:

6.	
Another argument that has sometimes been made is that the triumph 
of a “caring and sharing” interactional ethos reflects the growing 
feminization of British society. Certainly, new-style experts on com-
munication tend to extol the virtues of women, while reserving their 
sternest warnings for stiff upper-lipped British men. But we should 
not be misled by the fact that therapeutic norms for interaction 
somewhat resemble the popular “Mars and Venus” stereotype of the 
way women interact.
Similarly, in (7) when commenting on an advertisement for hospital 
cleaners, she first voices the “accepted view” only to dispute it, overturning 
what she projects as normal expectations:
7.	
The specification just quoted attracted criticism in the mid-1990s 
as an instance of the “politically correct” impulse to dignify even 
the most menial positions by describing them in absurdly elevated 
terms. In my view, however, what it really illustrates is a more 
general discursive and rhetorical shift in the way experts think and 
talk about all kinds of work.
This kind of concession is a highly productive move in persuasive discourse 
(e.g., Azar, 1997), but while often labeled “adversative,” it is both highly 
dialogistic, in that it invokes a contrary position, and reader sensitive. 
Cameron recognizes that persuasion requires the involvement of her readers 
and so seeks to acknowledge their value positions before leading them to her 
own. Interestingly, by marking the counter explicitly with “in my view” in (7), 
for example, Cameron both states her view unequivocally and presents it as 
just one possible opinion among others; the reader is invited to reserve 
judgment to follow her critique. I discuss this further below.
Establishing Solidarity
By presenting her own position in the context of another, Cameron is not only 
able to situate her arguments and so better demonstrate their distinctiveness 
and superiority but also able to claim solidarity with her readers.
Claiming temporary agreement with a thesis before following up with a 
counter claim is common in the Cameron texts, a sensitivity to addressees’ 
understandings which helps circumvent an early rejection of her argument. She 
first implies that it is not unreasonable to hold the countered position—after 
all, anyone might be deceived into doing so—and then adjusts their thinking to 
her own. This generally involves correcting rather than confronting readers’

expectations and is typically prefaced with a stance adverbial, often arguably 
(which is proportionately 30 times more frequent in Cameron’s texts):
8.	
It is true that both are most entrenched in the United States and are 
therefore easily seen as emanating from it. But arguably the diffu-
sion of new norms is less a consequence of American cultural 
influence per se than a consequence of the spread of the same 
social conditions which have enabled certain practices to flourish 
in the United States.
	
In most cases the styles of speech women are urged to adopt are 
presented as gender neutral; they are simply the most effective ways 
of using language in a particular domain, regardless of the speaker’s 
sex. Arguably however, this is only a subtler form of androcentrism.
	
Undoubtedly, the call centre industry is a hi-tech service industry 
which deals in symbols (words and bits); but as I will shortly seek 
to demonstrate by describing their work regime, the suggestion 
that operators have to deploy high levels of knowledge or skill in 
order to perform their functions is extremely misleading.
In other words, while she addresses issues head-on, she takes the trouble 
to avoid doing the same with her audience.
Forging an alignment with readers is also accomplished in Cameron’s 
writing by the considerable use she makes of conditional arguments, which 
occur proportionately over 200 times more frequently in her corpus than in 
the reference corpus. By making one circumstance dependent on another, 
these raise the uncertainty of outcomes and are therefore often considered to 
be hedging devices, but they also bring the writer and reader closer to agree-
ment. In Cameron’s work, the specification of an “open condition” treats the 
possibility of the condition being fulfilled as dependent on the reader’s 
agreement, as in these examples:
9.	
If we accept that women and men are internally diverse groups, the 
fact that some women do one thing while others do the opposite 
need not be considered a paradox at all.
	
If the hallmark of a mature academic field is its ability to set its 
own agenda for research and debate, should we not be addressing 
the questions we consider interesting rather than spending time 
debating other people’s unquestioned assumptions?
So once again, she acknowledges the multivocal context of her argument, 
but addresses voices assumed to be shared by both the writer and the addressee.

The way Cameron aligns herself with her readers against an alternative 
viewpoint is nicely illustrated in the following extract. Here she employs a 
series of if clauses to patiently set out the arguments that support the ideologi-
cal basis of education for the “knowledge society.” Construing the reader as 
perhaps sharing this apparently reasonable paradigm, she then, using the 
stance marker arguably and the contrasting conjunction though, expresses her 
own view. The final conditional, combined with the writer–reader inclusive 
we, suggests that all readers need to do is consider the nature of “knowledge 
work” to arrive at the same conclusions she does:
10.	 There is a sense in which the trend to up skilling actually makes 
this assertion true. If even quite low-level employees are thought 
to require formal instruction in such matters as how to talk to 
customers/clients/patients, if this is considered to be a highly 
skilled form of behavior which needs to be supported by a body of 
codified knowledge, and if acquiring the knowledge and skills 
through training becomes an obligation imposed on the workers 
by their employer, then these employees do, in a sense, become 
“knowledge workers.” Arguably, though, the sense in which they 
become knowledge workers is a very trivial and superficial one. 
And if we actually look at what is involved in many kinds of con-
temporary service work we will soon have cause to ask whether 
the rhetorical upskilling of these jobs masks a real deskilling of the 
workers who do them.
In Cameron’s discourse then, we see a range of rhetorical features used to 
confidently and forcefully advocate particular realities, often arguing for a 
way of seeing the world in contradiction to others. Her preferred argument 
strategies actively construct a heteroglossic backdrop for the text by explicitly 
grounding propositions in her individual subjectivity, recognizing that her 
view is one among others and taking on alternatives through a combative and 
confident dialogue. One consequence of this is the emergence of a distinctive 
identity as a steadfast and committed academic, a disciplinary expert 
confident in her beliefs and determined in her assurance.
John Swales: The Inquiring Colleague
John Swales, while enjoying similar academic celebrity, projects a very 
different identity to Deborah Cameron. Here is an altogether more self-effacing 
and conciliatory writer, projecting the identity of a cautious and inquiring

colleague exploring the mysteries of the ways people use language with the 
same curiosity and eye for classroom practice that his practitioner readers 
might. His rhetorical choices impart a clear personal attitude and a strong 
interpersonal connection to his readers, particularly through the use of self 
mention, hedges, and engagement.
Self Mention and Reflection
Frequent use of the first person is perhaps the most striking feature of Swales’ 
discourse, with both I and my occurring in the top ten keywords. Self-
referential I, me, and my, in fact, occur 9.1 times per 1,000 words in the 
Swales corpus compared with 5.2 in the applied linguistics reference corpus, 
imparting a clear authorial presence and a strong sense of personal investment 
to his writing. As these examples suggest, the reader finds a thoughtful and 
well-informed colleague in these texts: an impression of a real person thinking 
through issues:
11.	 But before I attempt to develop my main argument, it may first 
be helpful to place this aspect of applied linguistic research in 
a wider context lest I am thought to be even more obsessive-
compulsive about the importance of genre analysis than is actually 
the case.
	
I have on occasion proposed that students utilize models in their 
writing. I have done so only in those situations where I feel that 
research into the genre has reached a level of credibility to permit 
some generalization.
Here is a writer making decisions, weighing evidence and drawing 
conclusions, and engaging the reader in the discussion and investing his 
argument with personal experience. This self-reflexivity is apparent in this 
extract, where he comments on his changing teaching practices:
12.	 My students come from every conceivable department, but I try to 
make them a sociorhetorical community, a support group for each 
other. I do a lot of rhetorical consciousness raising and audience 
analysis . . . . I take them behind the scenes into the hidden world 
of recommendations, applications and evaluations . . . In actual 
fact, I am much less sure than I used to be that I am a language 
teacher. I have come to believe that my classes are, in the end, 
exercises in academic socialization.

This kind of writing conveys an openness and honesty that reaches out 
to readers as someone on the same wavelength and familiar with their own 
contexts and workplace challenges.
An interesting aspect of Swales’ identity is the extent to which self-
mention is used in a self-deprecatory way. Swales does not duck the fact that 
research involves uncertainties and failures, perhaps encouraging novice 
researchers by admitting that even the field’s most illustrious figures have 
their setbacks:
13.	 Although Huddleston claims that it is comparatively easy to sort 
examples into the obligation and logical conclusion meanings, I 
experienced greater difficulty and I have left 10% uncertainly 
classified.
	
But I am very unsure whether I will ever use these particular 
materials again. As matters stand at the moment, these materials 
have been, I believe, an educational failure.
	
Indeed, despite some trying, I have so far been unable to repeat my 
earlier success. Perhaps in the same way that composers only seem 
able to write one violin concerto, discourse analysts can produce 
only one successful model.
More generally, a concordance of the first person in Swales’ writing shows 
how far agency is explicitly associated with modality, or at least a deliberative 
attitude. The most frequent main verbs related to I are think (86), believe (71), 
suspect (35), hope (33), tried (31), and guess (29), all of which point to some 
degree of tentativeness and care in handling claims and readers. While I also 
appears frequently in Cameron’s writing, suggesting that experienced writers 
may be less cowed by admonishments to author to evacuate their prose, it is 
the extent and the use of self-mention in Swales’ writing that sets him apart 
and distinguishes his individual authorial identity.
Conveying, Hedging, and Attitude
A significant aspect of Swales’ personal involvement in his writing is the 
extent to which he infuses his texts with commentary on the accuracy of 
claims and his stance toward them.
The use of language to express caution and commitment is a key feature of 
academic writing as it not only conveys the writer’s assessments of reliability 
but also recognizes the heteroglossic character of statements (Hyland, 2004; 
Martin & White, 2005). Swales employs hedges throughout his work, opening

a discursive space that invites readers into a dialogue where they can consider 
and perhaps dispute his interpretations. This is, of course, if they are not 
beguiled by his candor. As these examples suggest, his arguments often 
accommodate any expectations that his reader have that their views will be 
acknowledged in the discourse:
14.	 The upshot of all these figures would seem to suggest that the 
anglophone grip on published research communications is both 
strong and tightening.
	
I was, I suspect, rather too easily seduced by the concept of 
discourse community. Perhaps all too willingly I made common 
cause with all those who have their own agendas for viewing dis-
course communities as real, stable groups of consensus holders.
	
I would suggest, therefore, that we need more HRD-type training 
for ESP instructors and practitioners, as an addition to advanced 
training in Applied Language Studies.
By marking statements as provisional in this way, Swales is able to both 
express his views and involve readers in their ratification, conveying respect 
for colleagues and their positions. This is because hedges help present 
statements as contingent and subjective, a product of the writer’s reasoning 
and therefore open to challenge. But while offering space for dialogic 
alternatives suggests doubt and expands possibilities for debate, it is also 
disarming as it addresses views that are potentially in tension with his own. 
So in making room for alternatives, Swales presents an identity as a reasonable 
and open-minded seeker of truth, more interested in reaching a plausible 
interpretation for events than pushing his own.
The intent behind this readiness to concede and negotiate is perhaps 
demonstrated by a willingness to present claims with unambiguous robust-
ness where necessary. The restrictive adverbs indeed, doubtless, certainly, and 
especially, for example, all occur proportionately 10 times as frequently in 
Swales’ writing than in the applied linguistics corpus. Expressions that boost 
his claims and restrict alternatives are evident at key points of his arguments:
15.	 However, in other ways it is definitely nonstandard.
	
Such pressures have undoubtedly contributed to the exponential 
growth of research journals and articles in the last few decades.
	
The key point I want to make here is that when matters do not 
go smoothly, we can find opportunities within encounters for 
conversation management.

But Swales never demonstrates, proves, or establishes, and only rarely 
finds or shows. Instead, his categorical assertions are more usually accompanied 
by an evaluative comment of some kind.
The expression of affect is relatively uncommon in academic articles and 
attitude usually concerns estimations of probability and value rather than 
ethical evaluations or emotions. Swales’ writing, in contrast, is peppered with 
attitudinal lexis of various kinds, with scholarly, important, best, and inter-
esting among a keywords list of around 30 items. These are almost always 
positive attributes that he largely employs to generously evaluate the research 
of others or underline strongly felt commitments to a particular viewpoint:
16.	 Certainly, I find it remarkable that even as proficient a nonnative 
user as Yao should have introduced such an unexpected, subtle, and 
self-evaluative question about her writing into the discussion.
	
However, the most interesting feature of the above extract is the 
way in which the method is described.
	
Some shift in the reading research area toward a genre perspective 
would seem highly desirable.
Through these acts of personal involvement and professional investment, 
we are invited to share his understandings and subscribe to his take on the 
ways that both people and language behave. By scattering expressions of 
attitude and mitigation through his texts, Swales creates for himself a dis-
tinctive discoursal style that allows him to convey ideas in a very personal 
way, engaging readers as a collegial guide, sharing their interests and creating 
a sense of participating in an unfolding exploration of issues.
Engaging With Readers
In addition to this extremely personal authorial stance, Swales constructs a 
collegial identity by taking the trouble to recognize and respond to the 
potential objections, misunderstandings, and processing difficulties of his 
readers. As well as softening his arguments, he also draws readers into a 
collusive web of agreement by assembling a professional context in which 
they are construed as intelligent colleagues sensible enough to follow what 
he has to say.
One aspect of this, and extremely unusual in current practice, is a quaint 
and rather dated reference to “the reader.” There are 16 mentions of the 
reader in the Swales data compared with just 1 in the reference corpus, 
and Swales uses it much like the 18th-century novelists to explicitly bring 
readers into the discourse at certain points, reminding them that they are

linked by a common curiosity and engaged in the same fascinating endeavor. 
These cases are typical:
17.	 By now the reader may have recognized that all our encounters so 
far lack what Professor Erickson calls “leakage”—the leaking into 
the functional frame of social and interpersonal elements.
	
Now, I can hear the reader thinking “Surely we can solve this 
problem by having the same teacher teach two matched groups of 
learners using two different methods.”
This projects a sympathetic and almost avuncular, tone to the discourse 
while, at the same time, leading readers to the writer’s view by putting 
thoughts, and even words, into their minds.
A more conventional way of engaging readers is the use of inclusive we. 
While binding the writer to the reader in this way is common in persuasive 
prose (Hyland, 2005), it is particularly salient in the Swales’ corpus where it 
is among the top 50 keywords. Unsurprisingly, most of these collocate with 
primary auxiliaries and modals, but we also see the considerable interactivity 
of this pronoun in Swales’ writing by noting the most frequent main verbs it 
combines with. Table 2 lists these together with their frequencies for up to 
three words to the right of we.
The fact that cognition verbs (see, find, know) head the list suggest 
something of how Swales uses inclusive we to recruit the reader into the 
interpretation process by assigning them a researcher role, guiding them 
toward a preferred reading of the evidence. Examples, however, show how 
this shades into explicit positioning of the reader:
18.	 In retrospect, we can see that the great attractiveness of this 
approach lay in the fact that it seemed eminently manageable to 
early LSP practitioners.
	
I think we know in our hearts that the real issues are about how 
ESP operations are perceived in the wider administrative and 
operational environment.

Don’t we all find that our scholarly drafting is slower than we 
had hoped, and don’t we often feel that other scholars of compa-
rable interests and experience must surely be writing faster than 
we do?
There is an attempt to build a relationship through an implicit claiming of 
solidarity with readers here, soliciting agreement by dialogue with equals. But 
there is also a more direct attempt to position readers and lead them along 
with the argument. The use of obligation modals with we signals a more 
assertive author seeking to focus readers’ attention and navigate them through 
his exposition to a particular understanding:
19.	 We can salvage something of our hopes. First, we need to go back 
and review what we mean by discoursal competence. Here we 
need to recognize both the difference and the relationship between 
conversation management and oral genre skills.
	
I now believe that we should see our attempts to characterize genres 
as being essentially a metaphorical endeavor.
More usually, however, he dilutes the imperative force of such directives 
(Hyland, 2002) by framing them with a modal to mitigate the imposition 
and transform an instruction into an invitation:
20.	 We might conclude, then, that the role of the subject specialist 
informant in RA genre analysis remains, given the current levels 
of evaluated experience, somewhat controversial.
	
However, it could be noted that in the research world there may 
be more occasions when we have (at least ostensibly) “a distinct 
communicative situation.”
Once again, these linguistic resources allow him to present his arguments 
with consideration for the reader, while not compromising the strength of 
his convictions.
Finally, in addition to the devices Swales uses to impart a particular 
interpersonal tenor, he engages readers through an array of interactive meta-
discourse options: resources that set out an argument for readers (Hyland, 
2005). There are numerous expressions among the keywords that indicate the 
attention Swales gives to monitoring his evolving text to make it coherent for 
readers, and particularly assessing what needs to be made explicit by frequently 
comparing and summarizing material as he goes along. An interesting, and

quirky, variation on this regular gisting of material is his use of introductory 
prefaces like it turns out that (14 occurrences) and as it happens (20), which 
cataphorically alert the reader to findings that might be considered somehow 
unexpected or counterintuitive:
21.	 Thus it turns out that certain legal, academic and literary texts all 
point to another kind of contract that can exist between writer 
and reader.
	
The Advanced Learners Dictionary (ALD) lists 21 meanings for 
point, the last of these consisting of a large grab bag of widely 
different idiomatic uses. As it happens, not all of these are repre-
sented in the current MICASE database, including the very first 
use given in the ALD.
These expressions help readers to navigate the discussion, but they do 
so by lending a strong interpersonal element to it, injecting an attitude of 
conviviality as Swales shares a certain surprise with readers at the unfailingly 
interesting nature of rhetorical and human behavior.
Conclusions: Thoughts on the Discursive 
Production of Identity
In this article I have presented the view that identity is, at least in part, 
constituted through our consistent language choices. The ways we talk 
and write are not simply a mimicry of community patterns but complicated 
means of constructing who we are, or rather, how we would like others to 
see us. They are the most obvious and unselfconscious displays of our 
routine engagement with the world, highlighting the ways identity is embed-
ded in interaction and sociality. I have also argued that corpus linguistics 
is not only a viable means of uncovering such routinized choices but per-
haps an indispensible way of operationalizing the concept of identity 
formation.
Corpus analysis can help illuminate the ways individuals construct fairly 
consistent authorial orientations by using the disciplinary resources available 
to them. I hope to have shown that while normative and constraining, the 
rhetorical conventions of our communities are also the raw materials from 
which we fashion our professional selves, creating, through recurring selec-
tion of a rhetorical repertoire, the people we want to be. Clearly this identity 
work does not preclude other identity choices in the writing of these authors, 
and on particular occasions they may well adopt different subject positions.

But the analyses suggest that these two experienced writers project who they 
are to readers over time in very different ways through the rhetorical choices 
they make to argue their ideas and engage with their readers.
It has to be said that I have taken a relatively easy route into the corpus 
analysis of identity by selecting two of the most rhetorically aware indi-
viduals writing in applied linguistics today. Both writers are professional 
discourse analysts and so are highly attentive to the effects of their choices. 
In his recently published memoir, for example, Swales (2009) observes,
Tim Johns used to say in our Birmingham days in the 1980s: “A good 
writer is one who makes a friend of his or her reader” and that, as much 
as anything, that is what I am still trying to do. (p. 206)
Similarly, Cameron’s own response to this article underlines the importance 
she attaches to the “aesthetics” of language and to “avoiding verbal clutter.” 
She points out,
I would say I am a pretty deliberate and self-aware writer of prose, I 
think about what I’m doing and am conscious of at least some of the 
recurrent features that make my style what it is. I’d rather come across 
as crude or even arrogant than leave the reader struggling to parse my 
sentences, or wondering at the end of them “what the hell is she actually 
saying?”
Interestingly, these orientations do not stand outside broad social models 
but draw on recognizable cultural traditions. Cameron’s energetically and 
intelligently combative style, which explicitly pits her ideas against others, 
seems to be informed by British traditions of open debate. The fact that she 
positions herself as a very public intellectual, at home in the media and in 
popular genres, and with a variety of high profile issues, brings a wider 
significance to her writing. Swales’ style, on the other hand, seems to 
represent a different kind of intellectual in public discourse—quieter, more 
urbane, and gently self-deprecating. This is not to say of course that they 
have not given these styles an individual stamp influenced by their own 
backgrounds and experiences, or perhaps added innovations to the repertoire, 
but simply that the identity options provided by academic disciplines do not 
exist in isolation from wider social and cultural practices.
Like all corpus work, the method is informed by numbers, largely frequency 
counts of keywords and collocations but constructed on interpretation. While 
these repeated uses represent each writer’s more or less conscious choices to

project themselves and their work in particular ways, my take on them is 
necessarily subjective. I have, however, tried to work as closely as possible 
with the data and this clearly points to consistently distinctive rhetorical 
choices within broad disciplinary boundaries. The analysis suggests that the 
performance of an identity is always shaped by our goals and by the demands 
of the context as we walk a tightrope between projecting an individual persona 
and taking on social roles and qualities valued by community members. As 
Gee (1999, p. 23) points out, discourses are “ways of being in the world,” so 
that language choices are always made from available resources and involve 
interactions between the conventions of the literacy event and the values and 
prior cultural experiences of the participants.
In summary, this article has sought to reveal something of how authorial 
positioning is consistently accomplished through repeated rhetorical acts. 
At the same time, I have also tried to make a small contribution to the meth-
odologies we might use to explore identity construction and to shed some light 
on the social processes at work in academic discourse communities. It might 
be argued, however, that this kind of discourse analysis fails to provide suffi-
cient context to understand identity performance. After all, I’ve conducted no 
interviews, explored no detailed biographies, and unpacked no narratives. 
Instead I have looked at texts and what, over and over again, is on the page. 
What this shows, above all else perhaps, is that academic communities are 
human institutions where actions and understandings are influenced by the 
personal and biographical as well as the institutional and sociocultural. They 
are sites where differences in worldview or language usage intersect as a result 
of the myriad backgrounds and overlapping memberships of participants.
This methodology therefore points to new ways of understanding and 
exploring identity that takes us beyond what individuals say about themselves 
to what they do in interaction on repeated occasions and how they build a 
consistent persona through discourse. In this view, identity can only be under-
stood through close analysis of the ways writers routinely draw on the
