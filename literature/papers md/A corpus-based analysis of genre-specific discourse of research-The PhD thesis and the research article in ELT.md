Writing a research article is not an easy task for novice researchers, who 
begin their study as outsiders in the academic community and who must 
deal with both the apprenticeship in their fields and the challenge of writing 
in a new genre. Moreover, PhD thesis is a genre which is very frequently 
“recontextualized” as a research article by the novice researcher. The aim of 
this study was to conduct a contrastive analysis of the genre-specific 
features of introductions in a corpus of theses written in PhD programs in 
ELT offered by Turkish universities and in a corpus of published research 
articles in ELT written by expert authors of different nationalities, in order 
to specify the similarities and differences in the authors’ use of lexico-
grammatical, discoursal and rhetorical features in the two corpora. The 
analyses included both a hand-tagged and a computerized analysis of the 
two corpora. Specifically, the vocabulary profiles, the readability statistics, 
the use of verb tenses and citations, the move-step structures and the author

presence markers of the two corpora were subject to contrastive analyses. 
The analyses revealed that the language of the RA introductions was 
structurally more academic, lexically dense, and thus, more difficult to read 
compared to the PhDT introductions. Moreover, although the CARS Model 
(Swales, 2005), to a large extent described the move-step structure of the 
RA introductions, it could not account for the move-step structure of the 
PhDT introductions. With respect to these variations, proposals were made 
to increase the effectiveness of the target PhD programs in empowering the 
novice researchers in their access to the discourse community of ELT.

Kendi alanlarındaki söylem topluluğuna yeni adım atan araştırmacılar için 
araştırma makalesi yazmak oldukça zor bir deneyimdir, çünkü hem bu 
toplulukta yeni olmanın hem de farklı bir metin türünde yazmanın zorlukları 
ile başa çıkmak zorundadırlar. Doktora tezlerinin araştırma makalesi olarak 
yeniden bağlamlandırılması (recontextualization) sıklıkla karşılaşılan bir 
durumdur. Bu çalışmada Türkiye’deki üniversitelerin İngiliz Dili Eğitimi 
doktora programlarında yazılmış tezler ile aynı alandaki uluslararası 
yazarlar tarafından yazılmış ve yayınlanmış bilimsel makalelerin giriş 
bölümleri dilbilimsel olarak incelenmiştir. Bu iki bütünce arasındaki 
dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, 
metinsel 
ve 
sözbilimsel 
öğelerin 
karşıtsal 
çözümlemesi yapılmıştır. Hesaplamalı dilbilim ve elle işaretleme yöntemleri 
kullanılarak her iki bütüncenin okunurluk istatistikleri, sözcük özellikleri 
(vocabulary profiles), atıf ve eylem zamanlarının kullanımı, adım yapısı ve 
yazarın metin içerisindeki varlığı ile ilgili belirticiler karşıtsal olarak 
çözümlenmiştir. Çalışmanın sonuçları makalelerin giriş bölümlerinin, 
tezlerin giriş bölümlerine göre, dilbilgisel-sözcüksel olarak daha akademik

ve daha yoğun olduklarını ve bu nedenle okunurluk düzeylerinin daha düşük 
olduğunu göstermiştir. Ayrıca, CARS Model’in (Swales, 2005) araştırma 
makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinin adım yapısını büyük ölçüde yansıtmasına 
rağmen, doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinin adım yapısını yansıtmadığı 
görülmüştür. Bu farklılıklar bağlamında, İngiliz Dili Eğitimi programlarında 
eğitim gören araştırmacıların daha etkili araştırma makaleleri yazabilmeleri 
için bazı öneriler getirilmiştir.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Background to the Study 
 
Over the last few decades, genre has been a focus of attention in the 
fields of rhetoric, composition studies, professional writing, linguistics and 
English for Specific Purposes (ESP). Originally, genre is a literary 
construct. However, today it has become a widely utilized framework for 
analyzing the form and function of nonliterary discourse such as the genre 
specific discourse of research. 
The definitions of the concepts of “genre” in genre analysis (Swales, 
1981: 1990) and “culture” in intercultural contrastive rhetoric (Connor, 
1996) have evolved since they were first presented. This evolution is best 
characterized by the terms dynamism and inclusiveness that are used to 
describe the concepts of genre and culture.  Connor (2004) points out that 
the term intercultural rhetoric in this century connotes the analysis of texts 
that allows for “dynamic definitions of culture and the inclusion of smaller 
cultures (e.g. disciplinary, classroom)” in the analysis (273).     
Swales (2004) also emphasizes the shift in the definition of genre from 
a static entity towards a dynamic entity by introducing the concept of 
“genre networks”. Describing genres with the metaphor of a network, 
Swales (2004) reflects his observation that genres in the research world are 
frequently transformed into other genres (See Figure 1).  
 
“Genre networks” is in fact the overall frame that can also capture 
other concepts within a genre constellation: genre chains, genre hierarchies 
and  genre sets (Swales, 2004). Genre networks are critical in justifying the 


## Page 17

claimed dynamism of the new perception of genre. Todorov (cited in Swales 
1990, 15), sets the fundamental arguments behind the concept of genre 
networks.

 Todorov remarks: 
 
Where do genres come from? Quite simply from other 
genres. A new genre is always the transformation of an 
earlier one, or of several: by inversion, by displacement, by 
combination.  
 
 
 
(1990, 15) (cited in Swales, 2004: 21) 
 
Swales (2004) argues that in the research world, genres form intertextual 
relationships with other genres. He points out that presentations can lead to 
research articles, but just as likely, research articles can lead to 
presentations. Moreover, published articles can both precede and follow 
theses, and further, articles can be combined into theses (2004, 22).  Swales 
(2004) calls these processes within the genre network “recontextualization” 
a term defined by Linell as follows: 


## Page 18

Recontextualization involves the extrication of some part or 
aspect from a text or discourse, or from a genre of texts or 
discourses, and the fitting of this part or aspect into another 
context, i.e. another text or discourse (or discourse genre) 
and its use and environment.  
 
  
 
 
 
(cited in Swales, 1998:145)  
 
With respect to the recontextualization of genres in a genre network, a 
close relationship between the PhD thesis and the research article exists. As 
also observed by Swales (2004), a very common practice in the research 
world is to recontextualize PhD theses as research articles. This might have 
several reasons, but probably the strongest motivation for transforming a 
PhD thesis into a research article is that the PhD thesis is the piece of work 
that has received the maximum amount of attention on the part of not only 
the scholar, but also the PhD supervisor.  
After completing a PhD thesis, the novice scholar is prepared to take a 
step into the discourse community (Swales, 1981, 1990) of the expert 
scholars by having a research article published in an academic journal.  
Swales (1984) describes publishing research articles as one of the academic 
“rites of passage” into a professional career. Dong (1998) also observes that 
doctoral theses which are based on a compilation of publishable articles are 
gaining popularity, since the research article is apparently regarded as the 
next stage of writing the PhD thesis.  
To sum up, PhD thesis is the masterwork of most scholars who have 
completed a PhD program and therefore it is the genre which is very 
frequently recontextualiazed a research article, which exists in the same 
genre network with the PhD. However, writing a research article is not an 
easy task for novice researchers, who begin their study as outsiders in the 
academic community, “unfamiliar with the rules of the game” (Gosden, 
1995: 39) of academic research. It can be particularly difficult for non 
English-speaking scholars, since they must deal with both “apprenticeship 


## Page 19

as novices in their fields of academic research” and the challenge of a new 
genre” (Gosden, 1995: 39). Canagarajah (1996) argues that researchers who 
are nonnative speakers of English have great difficulty in having research 
articles accepted by the English native-speaking academic discourse 
community because, no matter how rigorous their science, their lack of 
mastery of the genre conventions, and thus their lack of power in discourse, 
excludes their work from the journals. Flowerdew (2000) and  Misak et al. 
(2005) state that  nonnative-English-speaking scholars -other things being 
equal- are at  a disadvantage compared to their native-English-speaking 
peers when it comes to writing up the results of their research for 
publication.  
In Turkey, as in most of the PhD programs in other countries, publishing 
a research article in an academic journal is a not an obligation to receive a 
PhD degree. Therefore, the scholars generally start writing research articles 
after they complete their PhD theses, since having at least one article 
published in an academic journal is one of the requirements for receiving an 
assistant professorship in ELT.   
Although recontextualization of the PhD thesis as a research article is a 
common tendency in the research world and there are a number of genre 
analysis studies conducted in a variety of disciplines like medicine and 
biology, there is a scarcity of research studies that investigate the genre-
specific features of these two closely related genres for the field ELT. 
However, as Swales (1990, 2004), Canagarajah (1996) and Gosden (1995) 
point out, being aware of the genre specific features of the research article is 
a necessity for being accepted into the discourse community of an academic 
discipline.

1.2 The Study 
 
This study addressed the need for more research in contrastive genre 
analysis for the field of ELT.  Specifically, the aim of this study was to 
conduct a contrastive analysis of the genre-specific features of introductions 
in a corpus of theses written in PhD programs in ELT offered by Turkish 
universities and in a corpus of ELT research articles published by authors of 
different nationalities in major academic journals in order to specify the 
similarities and differences in the use of lexico-grammatical, discoursal and 
rhetorical features of these two genres. In this respect, this study addressed 
the lack of research in such contrastive studies in the context of PhD 
programs in ELT offered by Turkish universities. The analyses included 
both a hand-tagged move structure analysis (Swales, 2004) and a 
computerized analysis of the lexico-grammatical features of the two 
corpora.  
Gabrielatos and McEnery (2005, 312) note that a common feature of 
corpus research on both learner and academic language is comparison to a 
norm (See Figure 2). One tendency is to compare the language of learners 
and non-native speakers in general to that of native speakers.  The other 
tendency, as described by Gabrielatos and McEnery (ibid.) is to compare the 
language practices of NS postgraduate and research students, who can be 
seen as trainee academics, to those of established writers as evidenced in the 
discourse of published paper. However, the present study combines the 
features of the previous two in that it compares the language practice of 
NNS post-graduate students to that of expert writers, irrespective of whether 
they are native or non-native speakers (See Figure 3).

The focus of this study is specifically the introduction parts of the 
PhD theses and the research articles. The most important reason for this 
specificity is that regardless of their type and research design all kinds of 
theses and research articles involve introduction parts. Also, introductions 
are known to be problematic for most academic writers since “getting 
started on a piece of academic writing is often more difficult than its 
continuation” (Misak et al.., 2005).  Swales comments:

The opening paragraphs somehow present the writer with a 
demoralizing number of options: decisions have to be made 
about the amount and type of background knowledge to be 
included; decisions have to be made about an authoritative 
versus a sincere stance; decisions have to be made about the 
winsomeness of the appeal to the readership; and decisions 
have to be made about the directness of the approach. If we 
add to the above brief catalogue the assumption that first 
impressions matter (in an era of exponentially-expanding 
literature), then we are not surprised to note that over the 
last 10 years or so there has been growing interest in the 
introductory portions of texts.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1990, 137) 
 
Harwood (2005, 1210) further comments that with more research 
produced daily, scholars can only read so much; and unless the paper in 
question captures the readers’ attention, and is cited in future studies, it will 
be as if it never existed ever. Therefore, the opening paragraph of an article 
is particularly significant in terms of promoting the research.  
With respect to the findings of the previous studies, it was expected that 
a contrastive analysis would reveal variations in the lexico-grammatical, 
discoursal and rhetorical features of the PhDT and RA introductions, which 
should be addressed in recontextualizing PhD theses as research articles. 
The research questions formulated for this study were as follows:

Lexico-grammatical features: The lexico-grammatical features in this 
study comprised the lexical features of the texts such as frequency of 
content words, function words, AWL words, word strings, type-token-

family ratios, the use of verb tenses and the density of active and passive 
structures. 
 
Discoursal features: Discoursal features in this study entailed the move-
step structure of the texts within the framework of the CARS Model 
(Swales, 2004) which also included the analyses of citations and lexico-
grammatical features within each move and step.  
 
Rhetorical Features: In this study, rhetorical features were limited to 
author presence markers.   
  
 
1.3 Definition of Terms 
 
The operational definitions of some of the salient terms in this study are as 
follows: 
 
Genre:  Early definitions of genre describe it as fixed, immutable and 
homogenous. However, recent definitions of genre view it as more dynamic 
(Connor, 1996; Swales, 2004). This new definition of genre, which is 
influenced by the theories of Bakhtin (1993) is put forward by Connor 
(1996) as follows: 
 
Genres are not static, stylistically homogenous texts. 
Although texts, according to Bakhtin, have ordered, unified 
forms (for example, stories have a structure) they are also 
“intertextual”: that is, texts are ongoing processes of 
discourse production and reception that are always tied to 
other texts or utterances in a culture.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1996, 128)  
 
Swales (1990, 2004), whose research has been seminal in genre theory 
has introduced “moves” or “functional components” as basic elements of 


## Page 25

 
10
genre. According to him, genres are “communicative events” that are 
characterized both by their communicative purposes and by various 
patterns of structure, style, content and intended audience. A genre 
comprises a class of communicative events, the members of which share 
some set of communicative purposes. These purposes are recognized by the 
expert members of the parent discourse community, and thereby constitute 
the rationale for the genre. The rationale shapes the schematic structure of 
discourse and influences and constrains choice of content and style. 
Swales’ model of genre analysis, move structure analysis, classifies 
segments of texts according to their prototypical communicative purpose for 
a particular genre. In this respect, his model has been used as a framework 
in ESP research that focus on the analysis and teaching of the spoken and 
written language required of non-native speakers in academic and 
professional settings (Hyon, 1996).  
 
Discourse Community: The term discourse community was originally used 
by Swales (1990), who described it as a group of people who share a set of 
social conventions that is directed towards some purpose. Casanave (1995) 
further characterized it as consisting of the practitioners of a scientific 
specialty who share language, beliefs and practices.  The concept of 
discourse community also led to a more flexible definition of culture in 
contrastive rhetoric studies.  Today, discourse communities are also 
described and recognized as cultures (Connor, 2002).  
 
Thesis: Although the words “thesis” and “dissertation” are treated as 
synonyms in many sources, in this study “thesis” is used instead of 
“dissertation”. A minor difference in dictionary definitions of the words is 
that thesis is piece of work associated with higher university degrees such as 
PhD.  However, dissertation is a more general term for thesis also 
incorporating lower degrees such as undergraduate degrees.  


## Page 26

A thesis is a long piece of writing based on your own ideas 
and research that you do as part of a university degree, 
especially a higher degree such as a PhD. 
 
  
 
 
 
( Collins Cobuild Dictionary, 2001) 
Corpus:  
A corpus is a large computer-held collection of texts 
(spoken, written or both) collected together to stand as a 
representative sample or some part of it. Corpora provide 
easily accessible and accurate data, useful to descriptive and 
theoretical linguists. They may also be used to calculate the 
frequency of occurrence of items, as repositories of actual 
instances of language use. 
(Johnson and Johnson 1998: 89-90) 
Concordance:  
A list, today usually derived from a corpus, shadowing all 
instances of a chosen lexical item and indicating its 
immediate context (before and after). This allows 
statements to be made about the item’s collocation.  
(Johnson and Johnson, 1998:90) 
 
Collocation: Collocation is one of the binding forces in language, 
organizing lexis according to which words typically occur together and 
showing networks of word association (Johnson and Johnson, 1998: 89-90). 
 
Integral Citation:  
An integral citation is one in which the name of the 
researcher occurs in the actual citing sentence as some 
sentence-element. For instance, “Brie (1988) showed that the 
moon is made of cheese” is an integral citation.  
 
(Swales, 1990:147) 
Non-Integral Citation:  
In a non-integral citation, the researcher occurs either in 
parenthesis or is referred to elsewhere by a superscript number or 


## Page 27

 
12
via some other device. For example, “Previous research has 
shown that the moon is made of cheese (Brie, 1988).” is a non-
integral citation.  
 
(Swales, 1990; 147) 
 
Explicit Quotation:  The repetition of language from a source, made 
evident by the use of quotation marks or other typographical device. 
(Pecorari, 2006) 
 
Readability:  The research by Zipf (1949), Chafe and Danielewics (1986)   
and Biber (1988) indicate that high frequencies of nouns, lengthy words, 
prepositional phrases, attributive adjectives, type/token ratio and passives 
indicate high density of information integrated into a text and thus render 
the text more difficult to be processed by the reader. A high type/token ratio 
results from the use of many lexical items in a text, and this more varied 
vocabulary reflects extensive use of words that have very specific meanings. 
Precise lexical choice is a very difficult production task and is thus rarely 
accomplished in speech (Chafe and Danielewics, 1986). Longer words also 
convey more specific, specialized meanings than shorter words (Zipf, 1949).   
 
Flesch Reading Ease Readability Score:   By using Flesch Reading Ease 
readability score formula, a text can be assessed on a 100-point scale based 
on the average number of syllables per word and words per sentence. The 
higher the Flesch Reading Ease score, the easier it is to understand the text. 
The standard difficulty level is 60 to 69 on the scale. A text with a score of 
0-20 is considered to be difficult to understand. The formula for the Flesch 
Reading Ease score is “FRE = 206.835 - (1.015 x ASL) - (84.6 x ASW), 
where FRE stands for Flesch Reading Ease, ASL is avarage number of 
words in a sentence and ASW is avarage syllables per word.

Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Readability Score:  By using the Flesch-
Kincaid Grade Level readability score formula, a text can be  analyzed and 
rated on a U.S. grade-school level based. For example, a score of 12.0 
means that a twelfth grader would understand the text. The Flesch-Kincaid 
Grade Level readability score formula is “FKRS = (0.39 x ASL) + (11.8 x 
ASW) - 15.59, where FKRS stands for Flesch-Kincaid Readability Score.

CHAPTER II 
REVIEW OF LITERATURE 
 
2.1  The Corpus-Based Approach  
 
Language analysis studies can be grouped into two: studies of language 
structure and studies of language use. Language structure analysis entails 
the identification of structural units, classes of a language such as words and 
phrases and the description of how these units form larger grammatical 
units. Studies of language use, on the other hand, analyze how speakers and 
writers make use of the language. The corpus-based approach to language 
analysis focuses on the actual language used in naturally occurring texts 
rather than what is theoretically possible in a language. The essential 
characteristics of corpus-based analysis are:  
 
- 
It is empirical, analyzing the actual patterns of use 
in natural texts; 
- 
It utilizes a large and principled collection of 
natural texts, known as a “corpus”, as the basis for 
analysis; 
- 
It makes extensive use of computers for analysis, 
using both automatic and interactive techniques; 
- 
It depends on both quantitative and qualitative 
analytical techniques.  
Biber et al. (1998:4) 
 
A corpus-based approach to language analysis is more than simply 
counting the occurrence of linguistic items. Complex association patterns 
can be analyzed by exploiting a representative corpus. Biber et al. (1998, 6) 
describe these association patterns in two categories: linguistic and non-
linguistic associations.

2.2 The Research Article  
 
2.2.1 1990 Version of the CARS Model for the Introduction Parts of the  
         Research Articles 
 
Genre analysis of research writing has been deeply influenced by 
Swales’ (1990) Create A Research Space Model (hereafter will be referred 
as the CARS Model) (See Figure 4). Swales’ (1990) CARS Model is in fact 
a revised version of his earlier CARS Model (1981).  In the 1990 version of 
the CARS Model, Swales elaborated on some aspects of the model.  
Ecological analogy is one of these aspects. Swales (1990) argues that 
ecological analogy captures a number of characteristics of the research 
article introductions: the need to re-establish in the eyes of the discourse 
community the significance of the research field itself: the need to “situate” 
the actual research in terms of that significance; and the need to show how 
this niche in the wider ecosystem will be occupied and defended. It follows 
that the amount of rhetorical work needed to create such a space depends on 


## Page 31

 
16
the existing ecological competition, on the size and importance of the niche 
established, and on various other factors such as the writer’s reputation.  
In the 1990 version of the CARS Model, Move 1 has a “narrowing” 
effect, which is called “claiming centrality” by Swales (1990). In Step 1, 
centrality claims are directed to the discourse community who are asked to 
accept the research about to be reported as part of a lively, significant or 
well-established research area. Centrality claims can be made in several 
ways: by claiming interest or importance, by referring to the classic, favorite 
or central character of the issue, or by claiming that there are many other 
investigators active in the area.  Two of the typical examples of linguistic 
exponents of centrality claims given by Swales are the following.  
 
Recently, there has been a wide interest in … 
In recent years, applied researchers have become 
increasingly interested in … 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1990:144) 
 
 In Step 2, making a topic generalization, a more neutral general 
statement than Step 1 is made. Step 2 can be divided into two categories: 
statements about knowledge or practice, or statements about phenomena. 
Two examples of this step are the following.  
 
Education core courses are often criticized for… 
A standard procedure for assessing has been…

Step 3 in “establishing a territory” is the review of one or more items 
that are regarded by the authors as relevant to that establishment. This step 
is one of the occasions where the research article author needs to relate what 
has been found (or claimed) with who has found it ( or claimed it). More 
specifically, the author needs to provide a specification of previous findings, 
attribution to the researchers who established those results, and a stance 
towards the findings themselves.  
In addition to a categorization of citations as “integral” and “non-
integral”, Swales (1990) also proposes a correlation of the types of citations 
to the tenses used with each type of citation. Swales’ hypothesis is that 
Present Perfect is generally used when reporting about previous research 
and Present Tense or a modal is used when there is no reporting.  Moreover, 
Swales (1990) agrees with Malcolm’s observations about medical journal 
article. The three hypotheses stated by Malcolm are: 
 
1. Generalizations will tend to be in the Present Tense. 
(74%) 
2. References to specific experiments will tend to be in 
the Past Tense. (61%) 
3. References to areas of inquiry will tend to be in the 
Present Tense) (74%) 
                                                (Cited in Swales, 1990:32) 
Move 2 of the CARS Model is “establishing a niche”. Swales’ (1990) 
study with 100 research articles in different disciplines revealed that the 
gaps in previous research are presented with the following linguistic 
exponents: 
 
1. Negative or quasi-negative quantifiers (28 Instances)

“They center mainly on …rather than on…” 
 
“Researchers have focused primarily on…, as   
 
   
opposed to…” 
“Emphasis has been on…with scant attention 
given to…” 
“Although considerable research has been done 
on…much less is known as to” 
8. Problem-raising (2 instances) 
 
“The application presents a problem…” 
 
“A key problem in many…is…” 
 
 
                                        (1990, 156) 
 
With regard to Move 2, the other important issue is “cyclicity”. Swales 
(ibid.) comments that niche-establishment does not necessarily occur at the 
end of a literature review, but may follow reviews of individual items, so 
that cycles of Move 1/Step 3 and Move 2 recur.  
  
The third and the last move in the CARS Model, is labeled as 
“occupying the niche”. The role of Move 3 is to turn the niche established 
between the moves into a strong one. Whenever a Move 2 occurs, Move 3 
offers to validate the particular counter-claim that has been made, fill the 


## Page 35

 
20
created gap, answer the specific question or continue the rhetorically 
established tradition. The obligatory element in Move 3 is Step 1. This can 
take one of the two forms: 
 
 
Step 1A 
The authors indicate their main purpose or  
 
 
purposes 
 
Step 1B 
The authors describe what they consider to  
 
 
be the main features of their research.  
(Swales, 1990: 160) 
Two of the typical examples of linguistic exponents of Step 1 in Move 3 
given by Swales are the following.  
 
 
This paper reports on the results obtained… 
The aim of the present paper is to give… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1990, 160) 
As far as the language of Move 3 is considered, firstly, there is a strong 
tendency for the deictic signal to appear early and in general, the only items 
that precede them are the occasional linking phrases such as “In view of 
these observations”. Secondly, the tense is restricted to the present. 
However, in cases where the deictic refers to the type of inquiry 
(investigation, study, experiment, etc.), authors may choose between present 
and past.   
 
2.2.2 2004 Version of the CARS Model   
 
In 2004, Swales revised some aspects of the 1990 version of the CARS 
model in line with the results of the research studies that utilized the 1990 
version.  In the 1990 version of the CARS Model, Move 2 offers four steps 
of establishing a niche: counterclaiming, raising a question, indicating a gap, 
and continuing a tradition.  However, in the 2004 version of this model 
(Figure 5), Swales comments that “continuing a tradition” seems a rather 
odd choice of categorization, since it does not clearly answer the question of 


## Page 36

 
21
continuing a tradition of what? Additionally, Swales (2004) accepts that 
“indicating the gap” is by far the most common option. Also, the rarer other 
options of “counterclaiming”, or “question raising” may not functionally be 
very different from “gap-indication”. Therefore, in the 2004 version of the 
model, Swales proposes that these four realizations be reduced to two, and 
also that the model take on board the potential cycling of Move 1 and Move 
2 sequences, which many investigators have found to be prevalent 
especially in longer introductions.  
Another aspect of the CARS Model revised in the 2004 version is the 
third move. In the 2004 version, occupying the niche is seen as more 
complex and elaborated than the earlier version. Swales (2004) notes that it 
is apparent that separating the opening step (outlining purposes/announcing 
present research) from later ones is not always easy. Moreover, he 
comments that more options such as summarization, especially in papers 
whose principal outcome can be located in their methodological 
innovations, extended definitional discussions of key terms, detailing (and 
sometimes justifying) the research questions or hypotheses, and announcing 
the principle outcomes. Swales (2004) points out that in the 2004 version of 
Move 3 there are opportunities for the writers of research papers to expand 
upon the news value or interestingness of their work towards the end of their 
introductions. The availability of these options, as well as their actual uptake 
depends on a host of factors, such as the nature of the research, researchers’ 
aspirations, the status of the researchers themselves, the disciplinary 
conventions of their field and the like.

2.3 The PhD Thesis 
 
Dudley-Evans (in Thompson, 1999) terms the typical “IMRAD” 
(introduction- methods - results- analysis- discussion) type thesis a 
“traditional” thesis. Thompson (1999) categorizes theses as having 
“simple” and “complex” patterns of organization. According to him, a 
thesis with a “simple” traditional pattern is one which reports on a single 
study and has a typical macro-structure of “introduction”, “review of the 
literature”, 
“materials 
and 
methods”, 
“results”, 
discussion”, 
and 
“conclusion”. A thesis with a “complex” internal structure is one which 
reports on more than one study. It typically begins with “introduction” and 
“review of the literature” sections, as with the simple traditional thesis. It 
might then have a “general methods” section which is followed by a series 
of sections which report on individual studies. The thesis concludes with a 
general overall conclusions section. (Thompson, 1999) 
Dudley-Evans (in Thompson, 1999) refers to a third type of thesis 
called the topic-based thesis. This kind of thesis starts with an introductory 
chapter which is then followed by a series of chapters which have titles 
based on sub-topics of the topic under investigation. The thesis then ends 
with a “conclusions” chapter. 
Dong(1998) describes doctoral theses which are based on a compilation 
of publishable articles. The research article chapters are more concise than 
typical thesis chapters with less of the “display of knowledge” that is often 
found in a thesis. Further in terms of audience, they are written more as 
“experts writing for experts”, than novices writing for admission to the 
academy. 
Paltridge (2002) has conducted a study to investigate the theses types 
and the study areas they are commonly written in (Table 1).  According to 
the findings of this study, all kinds of theses have introduction parts. Also,

the traditional or simple theses are the most common theses types for the 
fields of applied linguistics and education.  
Although PhD theses are similar in some ways to other pieces of 
research writing, such as research articles, they are also in some ways quite 
different. (Dudley-Evans, in Thompson, 1999). Apart from the scale of the 
piece of writing, they also vary in terms of their purpose, readership, the 
kind of skills and knowledge they are required to demonstrate and display, 
and the kinds of requirements they need to meet (Thompson, 1999).  
Dudley-Evans (1989, in Bhatia, 1993: 7) identified a larger, 6 move pattern 
for thesis introductions in different fields (Figure 6). This model is in fact a 
version of Swales’ CARS Model. According to this model, in  PhD theses 
more space for Move 1, “establishing territory” is allocated and more 
information about the general and specific topic is given.  
Bunton’s  (1998) analysis of 13 PhD theses in different fields revealed 
that the introductions were hugely variable in length (from three to forty-six 
pages and equally variable in the number of references to the literature 
(from none to 135). Part of this variability was due to the existence of a 
“literature review” chapter. Thus, Bunton  (1998) developed two models 
for PhD theses introductions, one based on the 7 science and technology 
texts (ST) and the other on the 6 humanities and social science texts (HSS). 
Although he kept a three-part structure for article introductions (Swales, 
1990) for both, he added several additional steps. In his move structure, the 
opening move included “giving background information” and “defining 
terms”, while HSS texts could also lay out the “research parameters” . The 
second move in introductions from both areas was to “establish a niche” 
likely to take the form of elaborating on a particular research problem, as 
opposed to indicating a gap. The third move, “occupying the niche” was the 
most extensively elaborated one in Bunton’s corpus, particularly in HSS. In 
addition to the expected closing section outlining the structure of the thesis, 
there were steps that dealt with the rhetorical position adopted, outlined the

research questions/hypotheses, defined terms, summarized methods and 
materials, and offered predictions of what might later be discovered.

2.4 Computerized Techniques and Corpus Linguistics in Genre  
       Analysis 
 
Alongside with the growing popularity of genre studies in a wide range 
of fields, the techniques for genre analysis have been shaped by the current 
advances in corpus linguistics and computer technologies. The computer 
held specialized corpus is a new source of data not only for SLA research, 
but also for genre analysis. The most important reason for the recognition of 
its value is that the machine readable corpus is a reliable, replicable and a 
quick method to search for, retrieve, sort and calculate very large quantities 
of data. In his latest book, Research Genres, Swales (2004) also laments for 
the fact that corpus linguistics was in its infancy when he wrote his previous 
book, Genre Analysis in 1990. He believes that besides the world wide web, 
corpus linguistics is a development that will have impact on the genre-based 
studies.  
  
In this increasingly technological world, there is one more 
specialized software development of particular relevance to 
genre-based studies and applications. This is corpus 
linguistics, some collection (or corpus) of electronic texts 
plus some appropriate concordancing software, which 
permits assembly of key words in context, instant word 
frequency lists of various kinds, and distributional plots of 
selected words and phrases. At the time of writing of Genre 
Analysis, corpus linguistics was in its infancy, and there was 
almost no corpus material easily available that was directly 
applicable to those working in EAP and ERP (English for 
Research Purposes).  
 
 
 
 
 
Swales (2004, 8) 
 
However, as Upton and Connor (2001) also remark, most of the corpus-
based analyses have merely centered on the lexico-grammatical patterning 
of texts with less emphasis on discoursal, rhetorical and textlinguistic 
aspects.

2.5 Corpus-Based Genre Analysis Studies  
 
 
One of the most extensive corpus-based genre analysis studies was held 
by Biber in 1988. In this study Biber (1988) provided a unified linguistic 
analysis of the whole range of spoken and written registers in English. 
Computational analysis of the linguistic characteristics of 23 spoken and 
written genres resulted in the identification of the basic, underlying 
dimensions or parameters of variation in spoken and written English. The 
outcome of this study was co-occurring patterns for each genre such as 
nominalizations/ passives and pronouns/contractions (See Figure 6).

Biber (1988, 14) comments that the conversational text and scientific 
text are quite different with respect to the linguistic features. The scientific 
text has almost seven passives per 100 words and eleven nominalizations 
per 100 words; the conversation has no passives and less than one 
nominalization per 100 words. This frequency count indicates that passives 
and nominalizations tend to co-occur and thus belong to the same linguistic 
dimension- when a text has many passives, it also has many 
nominalizations. The same relationship exists for the pronouns and 
contractions. First and second person pronouns and contractions belong to 
the same dimension-when a text has many first and second person pronouns, 
it also has many contractions. While the use of the passive (and other “low 
transitivity” constructions) may be indicative of indirectness and opacity in 
certain types of discourse, its use in scientific discourse may be more 
accurately characterized as giving the actions prominence over agency. 
(Park and Stapleton, 2003, 245) 
Salager-Meyer (1992) utilized a corpus of 84 medical English abstracts 
written by native speakers of English to examine the verb tense and 
modality usage in these abstracts. The three major genres were research 
papers, case reports and review articles. Also, in order to analyze how the 
meaning conveyed by the different tenses and modal verbs is related to the 
communicative function of the different rhetorical divisions of abstracts and 
that of each medical English text type, the study also involved a move 
analysis.  The results validated that such a relationship existed and that there 
was a close parallelism between the rhetorical function of the moves in the 
texts and the tense used within these moves. Moreover, it was found out that 
modality was more frequent in certain medical genres than in others.  
Pickard (1995) conducted a concordance study of a corpus of 11 applied 
linguistics articles to explore how and why expert writers used quotations 
and citations and to analyze the lexical and grammatical choices they made. 


## Page 45

 
30
He found that the authors tended to prefer integral citations in the present 
tense. Moreover, argue, suggest, propose and cite were the most frequent 
reporting verbs occurring in integral citations.  
Anthony (1999) evaluated the CARS Model (Swales, 1990) in terms of 
how well it could be applied to 12 articles which have received “Best Paper” 
awards in the field of software engineering. The results indicated that 
although the model adequately described the main framework of the 
introductions, a number or important features were not accounted for, in 
particular, an extensive review of background literature, the inclusion of 
many definitions and examples, and an evaluation of the research in terms 
of application or novelty of the results.  
Posteguillo (1999) analyzed a corpus of 40 articles from three different 
academic journals in computing research. The results of the study revealed 
that the IMRAD pattern could not be applied to research articles in 
computer science systematically.   
Salager-Meyer (1999) analyzed a corpus of 162 medical articles 
published in different British and American journals between 1810 and 
1995. The aim of this study was to examine qualitatively and quantitatively 
the diachronic evolution of referential behavior in medical English written 
discourse within a social constructivist perspective. In this study, it was 
found out that some referential patterns were clearly typical of 19th century 
medical discourse; others typified early 20th century articles, and others 
were truly characteristic of late 20th century medical papers. The diachronic 
evolution observed in the use and frequency of reference patterns over the 
185 years studied reflected the conceptual shift from a non-professionalized, 
privately and individually-based medicine to a professionalized and 
specialized medicine, a technology oriented medical research and a highly 
structured scientific community. 
Marco (2000) conducted a corpus-based analysis to discover certain 
linguistic patterns such as collocational frameworks that are selected and 


## Page 46

 
31
favored in medical research papers written by native speakers of English. 
Through the analysis, it was found out that medical research papers had a 
specific phraseology and some of the triplets which occurred frequently in 
this genre were less frequent in other types of discourse. More importantly, 
it was found out that these phrases were associated with specific moves of 
the research paper.  
Green et al. (2000) performed a corpus-based enquiry of how Chinese 
writers of academic texts in English utilized theme position. The study 
aimed at testing the common belief that Chinese writers had a tendency to 
overuse certain topic-fronting devices and logical connectors. A corpus of 
academic writing produced by Chinese subjects was tagged to detect 
occurrences of the topic-fronting devices and the logical connectors. The 
same phenomena were similarly investigated in three native speaker 
corpora. The findings demonstrated that Chinese subjects had greater 
tendency than native speakers to place the connectors under consideration in 
theme position, but the findings were less clear for the topic-fronting 
devices. 
Upton and Connor (2001) conducted computerized corpus analysis to 
investigate the textlinguistic discourse moves of a genre. This study is 
significant for adopting a  textlinguistic approach to the computerized 
analyses of corpora, which is also advocated by Biber et al. (1998) and 
Flowerdew  (1998).  In this study, Upton and Connor responded to Biber et 
al. (1998) and Flowerdew’s   (1998, 2004) call for corpus-based analyses 
that must go beyond simple counts of linguistic features. The corpus used by 
Upton and Connor (2001) was a collection of letters obtained from the 
Indianapolis Business Learners Corpus (IBLC). The goal of the study was to 
locate in the corpus cross-cultural differences which may ultimately 
influence the efficacy of the letters of application written by the learners of 
different nationalities, Americans, Finns and Belgians. The study employed 
a multi-level corpus analysis. In the first level, the lexico-grammatical 


## Page 47

 
32
features of the texts were identified and an analysis based on Swalesean 
genre moves was performed. In the second level, negative and positive 
politeness strategies employed in the letters by the learners of different 
nationalities were analyzed.  The results showed that none of the three 
groups used either positive or negative politeness strategies exclusively, or 
even more frequently.  
Matsuda (2001) analyzed a corpus of web diaries written by Japanese 
speakers to find out how linguistic features such as self-referential pronouns 
and sentence-final participles were used in creating voice in Japanese 
written discourse. The aim of the study was to test the common perception 
that Japanese culture is collectivist, and by inference, Japanese students are 
often assumed to be less comfortable with the notion of voice than their U.S. 
counterparts. The analyses revealed that voice existed in Japanese written 
discourse, although some of the ways in which it was achieved were 
different from English written discourse.  
Ferguson (2001) conducted a corpus-based study of formal, semantic 
and pragmatic aspects of conditionals in naturally occurring medical 
discourse of English doctors practicing in England. The aim of the study 
was to find out whether the use of conditionals varied across the genres of 
medicine. Three corpora of different medical genres were selected for the 
study: research articles, journal editorials and doctor-patient consultations. 
The analysis indicated that there were differences in the use of conditionals 
across genres, and in particular, between the written and spoken genres. 
Moore (2002) analyzed a corpus of textbooks from three disciplines-
sociology, physics, and economics. Specifically, the study analyzed the 
frequency and type of agentive elements (participants and processes) in 
textbooks to find out the extent to which knowledge in these disciplines is 
attributed to individual scholars, schools of thought, conventional wisdoms 
and the like, as opposed to being realized in a non-attributed canonical form.  
The analyses revealed that with respect to the feature of metaphenomenon, 


## Page 48

 
33
economics textbook discourse is arguably more akin to that of physics than 
its social science counterpart, sociology.  
Peacock (2002) analyzed the communicative moves in discussion 
sections across seven disciplines -Physics, Biology, Environmental Science, 
Business, Language and Linguistics, Public and Social Administration, and 
Law. The corpus was 252 research articles (36 from each discipline, 1.4 
million words). In this study, a number of marked interdisciplinary and 
NS/NNS differences were found in the type and number of moves and move 
cycles.  
Brett (2002) analyzed a corpus of 20 research articles from the discipline 
of sociology to present a provisional, pedagogically usable description of 
the communicative categories or moves found in the “results” sections. In 
this study, these categories or moves were described in terms of function, 
lexis, and grammatical form. Moreover, a model of the typical, cyclical 
patterns formed by combinations of the categories was given. The analysis 
revealed that the moves found had certain similarities with the “discussion” 
sections of hard science research articles, and provided evidence of 
disciplinary variation. 
Samraj (2002) analyzed research article introductions from two related 
fields, Wildlife Behavior and Conservation Biology, using the CARS model. 
The results of the analysis revealed disciplinary variation in the structure of 
this genre. The results also indicated that a greater degree of embedding was 
needed in the CARS Model to account for the structures found in the 
introductions analyzed.   
In Samraj’s (2002) revised model of the CARS Model, “reference to 
previous literature” is not an element that is just found in Move 1. It can 
play a prominent role in Move 2, when it is used to support gaps in previous 
research. Instead of a cyclical pattern of literature review followed by a gap, 
Samraj suggests that the literature review can be subsumed under the 
rhetorical function of gap being created. In addition, a discussion of 


## Page 49

 
34
previous research can be subordinated to the function of providing a topic 
generalization. The review of literature in introductions is a step that can 
also be subordinated within another step in a different move, e.g., the 
specification of the goal of the study (Move 3, Step 1). A greater degree of 
embedding was present in the rhetorical organization of the texts analyzed 
in this study than was captured by the CARS model.  The results of the 
study suggested that discussion of previous research was an element that did 
not establish the territory (Move 1) but could also be employed to realize 
steps that belonged to other moves.  Consequently, according to Samraj 
(2002) discussion of previous research should not be a part of any particular 
move in the model. Instead, it should be a freestanding sub-step that can be 
employed in the realization of any step in the introduction. Claiming a free-
standing sub-step, discussion of previous research, accounts for the presence 
of reference to previous research throughout that introduction as well as the 
variety of rhetorical functions that is accomplished by a discussion of 
previous research. This has implications for the constituent structure of 
Move 1. Samraj (2002) argues that the first move contains two steps- 
centrality claims and background information on the topic (See Figure 7). 
The second step tends to have a general to specific structure and usually 
begins with statements that previously would have been categorized as topic 
generalizations. Research article introductions vary in the importance of 
discussions of previous literature in Step 2 of Move 1.  
Samraj (2002) proposes further options that can be added to the CARS 
model in the realization of some steps. Her analysis revealed that “centrality 
claims” and “gap specification” can be in terms of research world or the real 
world in different disciplines. Her study also indicated a need for another 
step “positive justification” in Move 2. Samraj (2002) points out that this 
step never appears by itself but always in conjunction with another step. 
Finally, Samraj (2002) comments that modifying the CARS model to 
account for the presence of the rhetorical move “background information on 


## Page 50

 
35
species or site” is quite problematic. The results of her analyses support the 
addition of a sub-step to the first step of Move 3, presenting goals of present 
research. It could be also be a component of the step “background 
information on the topic” in Move 1. This sub-step “background 
information on species or site” can also occasionally re-present itself as an 
independent move that appears between moves 2 and 3. Samraj (2002) 
argues that the variation in the hierarchical status (move or sub-step) and 
linear position of this rhetorical function even within introductions from one 
discipline illustrates the difficulty of postulating a single organizational 
framework for a particular genre/sub-genre.  Thus, some discoursal aspects 
of a genre may exhibit a greater degree of flexibility in their position within 
the overall organization of that genre.  
Hyland (2002) compared a corpus of L2 undergraduate reports in 
different disciplines with a corpus of research articles. He observed that his 
L2 informants mainly used first person pronouns in non-controversial 
contributions, such as stating discourse goals referring to methodological 
approaches, but avoided using them in the expression of arguments or 
opinions. 
Hyland 
(2004) 
examined 
the 
purposes 
and 
distributions 
of 
metadiscourse in a corpus of 240 doctoral and masters dissertations totaling 
four million words written by Hong Kong students. The analysis suggested 
how academic writers used language to offer a credible representation of 
themselves and their work in different fields, and thus how metadiscourse 
could be seen as a means of uncovering something of the rhetorical and 
social distinctiveness of disciplinary communities.  
Hyland and Tse (2005) investigated the frequencies, forms and functions 
of evaluative that in the two corpora of 465 abstracts from research articles, 
masters and doctoral dissertations written by L2 students. Comparing 
student and published use of the structure across six disciplines, they found 
that evaluative that was widely employed in the abstracts and was an 


## Page 51

 
36
important means of providing author comment and evaluation. They also 
identified the similarities and differences in how these groups used the 
structure by exploring what the writers chose to evaluate, the stances they 
took, the source they attributed the stance to, and how they expressed their 
evaluations.

Harwood (2005) conducted a qualitative corpus-based study to 
investigate how academic writers used the personal pronouns I and we to 
help create a self-promotional tenor in their prose. A 325.000 words corpus 
of 40 articles from four disciplines- Physics, Economics, Computing 
Science and Business and Management- was analyzed. The study showed 
that even supposedly “author-evacuated” articles in the hard sciences can be 
seen to carry a self-promotional flavor with the help of personal pronouns. 
According to Harwood (2005) the thought that academic writers 
protected themselves against falsification by distancing themselves from 
their findings and avoiding personal pronouns is losing ground these days. 
This is partly because more research is being conducted now than at any 
time previously and it is harder to get people’s attention in this crowded 
environment. Thus, the use of personal pronouns has increased in years. The 
corpus studies on the use of personal pronouns in academic writing have 
identified a number of functions that I and we can play. (e.g, Hyland, 2001; 
Kuo, 1999; Tang and John, 1999, Vassileva, 1998; Gragson and Selzer, 
1990). Harwood describes (2005, 1210) these functions as follows:  
 
(1) to help the writer organize the text and guide the reader 
through the argument (e.g. First I will discuss x and then 
y),  
(2) state personal opinions and knowledge claims (On the 
basis o my data, I would claim), 
(3) recount experimental procedure and methodology (We 
interviewed 60 subjects over the space of several 
months), and 
(4) acknowledge 
funding 
bodies, 
institutions, 
and 
individuals that contributed to the study in some way (I 
thank Professor X for his help with the calculations.)   
 


## Page 53

 
38
Ivanic (1998, 308) argues that the use of the first person “in association 
with knowledge claims and beliefs acknowledges the writer’s responsibility 
for them and property rights over them”. Harwood (2005, 1211), on the 
other hand, points out that the pronouns of I and we are linked with the 
authorial presence and the visibility of the writer in the text.  Harwood 
(2005, 1211) identified three distinct ways that authors use self-promotional 
I and we.  
(1) 
Personalizing claims: the writer as authority and 
originator 
 
The authors use the pronouns I and we to market themselves 
and 
their 
research 
by 
constructing 
a 
picture 
of 
newsworthiness 
and 
uniqueness. 
Pronouns 
link 
the 
researchers to their findings, showing that the writers are 
responsible for the claim. The effect can be to persuade the 
reader that the writers, like the claim they are putting 
forward, are worth taking notice of.  
 
We have demonstrated a system capable of texture 
segmentation (Kuo, 1999: 131) 
 
(2) 
Procedural soundness and uniqueness: 
 
This second type of self-promotional pronoun occurs during 
the description of method. This can be interpreted as more 
than a straightforward reporting of procedures: by using 
pronouns to highlight their own contribution to work, writers 
can be seen to be advertising their worth as researchers. 
 
 In this work, we present an approach by which the present 
experimental restrictions can be overcome. (Kuo, 1999: 125) 
By helping the researchers to describe their procedures in 
depth, I and we also mark the writer’s methodology out as 
their own, highlighting its uniqueness: 
 
In 1995 I went to Mexico and Chiapas to better understand 
the Zapatista movement. I visited many people, men and 
women, from and around the movement, and discussed with 
them the questions treated in this article. I am formulating 
them as “questions to Ramona” (Hyland, 2001: 220) 
 
(3) Self-Citation 
 
One of the most obvious ways researchers can show that 
they deserve to be taken seriously is via self-citation. 


## Page 54

 
39
Reference to one’s previous work is a powerful weapon in 
the quest for disciplinary ratification and credibility, 
showing that the researcher is in the vanguard of the research 
and is working on issues which are preoccupying the 
discipline at the time of writing.  
 
Martinez (2005) compared the use of first person in a corpus of biology 
articles produced by non-native English-speaking (NNES) writers and a 
corpus of research article manuscripts produced by native English-speaking 
writers, focusing on first person distribution and function in the different 
sections. The results revealed under-use, over-use and phraseological 
problems in the NNES corpus. The first person occurred in all sections of 
both corpora, with significant differences of use across sections. The most 
notable differences occurred in the Results section, where NES used first 
person mainly to show that they assumed responsibility for the 
methodological decisions that led to the results obtained.  
 
Gabrielatos and McEnery (2005) compiled and analyzed a corpus of 273 
MA dissertations written by students at the Department of Linguistics and 
English Language at Lancaster University. They compared the use of 
epistemic modality by native and advanced non-native speakers of English 
in this corpus. The analyses revealed interesting similarities and differences 
in the usage of epistemic modality by the two groups. Both groups used a 
small number of clusters and shared nine out of ten most frequent types. 
However, NS students used epistemic adjectives/adverbs significantly more 
frequently than NNS. Gabrielatos and McEnery (2005) comment that the 
similarities and differences between NS and NNS students in the corpus can 
be traced to the first language and/or the cultural and educational contexts of 
NNS students. In particular, the use of epistemic modality in the NNS 
students’ practices is influenced by the status and practices of epistemic 
modality in the educational and academic contexts of the students.  
 
Kwan (2006) examined a corpus of 20 doctoral theses produced by 
native English speaking students of applied linguistics. The aim of the study 


## Page 55

 
40
was to identify the rhetorical structure of the RL (Review of Literature) 
chapter and compare it with the revised CARS model (Bunton, 2002) that 
has been posited for thesis introductions. The analysis revealed that 
although most of the steps in Bunton’s revised CARS model were present in 
the move structures, some new steps were also distinguishable. The findings 
suggest that LRs and introductions may not be structurally entirely the same.  
 
Pecorari (2006) investigated the visible and occluded features of 
postgraduate second-language writing in a corpus eight PhD and nine 
master’s theses written by NNSEs in the fields of biology, civil engineering, 
linguistics and education. The writers in this study were found to respond to 
their disciplines’ expectations in terms of the visible aspects of source use, 
but with regard to the occluded features  their writing diverged considerably 
from received disciplinary norms. The findings also suggested that, with 
respect to disciplinary norms, a gap may exist between what is prescribed 
and what is practiced.  
 
Nelson (2006) examined the semantic associations of words found in the 
business lexical environment by using a one-million word corpus of both 
spoken and written Business English. The results indicated that not only do 
words in the business environment had semantic prosodies, that is, they 
were found to regularly collocate with word groups that shared semantic 
similarity, they also had prosodies that are unique to business, separate from 
the prosodies they generated in the “general English” environment.  
 
Magnet and Carnet (2006) investigated Letters to the Editor, a section in 
biomedical journals used by scientist since the early 19th century to question 
already validated research. The aim of the study was to highlight some of 
the discursive strategies and to bring to the fore the linguistic characteristics 
of this particular genre, to analyze its goal, role and use within a community 
of French researchers. The analysis was based on a corpus of 200 letters 
selected from two scientific journals. The results indicated that letters to the

41
editor had a common move pattern and linguistic features distinct from 
those used in the research article.  
 
Mudraya (2006) analyzed a corpus of 2.000.000 running words, The 
Student Engineering Corpus (SEEC), reduced to 1200 word families or 
9000 word-types encountered in engineering textbooks that were 
compulsory for all engineering students, regardless of their fields of 
specialization. The implication of the findings was that sub-technical 
vocabulary as well as Academic English should be given more attention in 
the ESP classroom.  
 
Charles (2006) investigated the phraseological patterning that occured in 
reporting clauses used to make references to others’ research. Specifically, 
finite clauses with that-clause complement were examined in two corpora of 
theses written by native speakers in contrasting disciplines: approximately 
190.000 words in politics/international relations and 300.000 words in 
materials science. The findings showed that both disciplines used significant 
numbers of these reporting clauses and that they most frequently occurred as 
integral citations with a human subject.   
Crossley (2007)  reviewed a corpus of 34 cover letters written by native 
and non-native speakers of English. The aim of the study was to examine 
Bakhtin’s theory that a genre’s unity is defined by its chronotype. The 
linguistic markers of time and space were compared to establish chronotopic 
move markers and chronotopic generic differences.  
Öztürk (2007) explored the degree of variability in the structure of 
article introductions within a single discipline. The study analyzed a corpus 
of 20 research articles to reveal the differences between two subdisciplines 
of applied linguistics, namely second language acquisition and second 
language writing research, within the framewok of Swales’ CARS model. 
The two disciplines seemed to employ different and almost unrelated move 
structures. In the second language acquisition corpus one type of move 


## Page 57

 
42
structure was predominant while in the second language writing corpus two 
different types of move structure were almost equally frequent.  
Fuertes-Olivera (2007) investigated lexical gender in specialized 
communication using a 10 million corpus of written Business English. The 
analysis revealed mixed results. For instance for each “woman” referred to 
in the corpus, there were more than 100 occurrences for man. On the other 
hand, Ms was found to be more than 9 times as frequent as Mrs.  and Miss.

CHAPTER III 
METHOD 
 
3.1 Data  
 
The data in this study were two genre-specific corpora: the PhD theses and 
the research articles. The data analyses included computer-supported and 
hand-tagged analyses of these two corpora.  
 
3.1.1 The Corpus of the PhD Theses 
 
The 83223 word corpus of the PhD theses included the theses written 
between the years 2001 and 2006 by nonnative English speaking PhD 
students enrolled in the PhD programs offered by 6 Turkish universities 
(See Table 2). In fact at the time of this study, there were 8 universities in 
Turkey which offered PhD programs in ELT. However, two of these 
universities were not represented in the corpus since the theses produced in 
these universities did not completely meet the criteria set for this study. 
These theses either had a linguistics or literature focus or they were written 
in Turkish.   
Specifically, the corpus represented the introduction parts of the PhD 
theses written in English and written between the years 2001 and 2006 by 
students enrolled in PhD programs in ELT at Turkish universities (See 
Appendix A for a list of the theses included in the corpus). The theses 
completed earlier than 2001 were not included in the corpus, since a 
diachronic analysis of the theses was out of the scope of the present study.   
 To ensure the validity of the findings, only the theses reporting 
empirical studies within the field of ELT were selected. Thus, some of the 


## Page 59

 
44
theses with a different focus such as linguistics, literature, general education 
and translation were left out, although they met the other criteria. The 
corpus comprised the theses reporting empirical studies only, as the 
rhetorical structure of theoretical articles might be different from the 
empirical studies.   Since not many theses complied with the selection 
criteria, an equal distribution of the theses over the years and the universities 
could not be possible.

3.1.2 The Corpus of the Research Articles 
 
The 22616-word corpus of the research articles was utilized as the 
reference corpus in this study. It comprised 25 research articles published 
between the years 2001 and 2007 by authors of different nationalities in 
major academic journals (See Appendix B for the list of the research articles 
included in the corpus).   
The journals were selected according to two criteria: their ratings among 
ELT scholars and their impact factors (See Table 3).  Twenty academics 
who held a PhD in ELT or studying for a PhD were asked to name and rank 
the 5 most prestigious journals that publish research articles related to ELT. 
“Prestigious journal” was defined as a journal that they would want their 
research articles to be published in.  
The responses were then scored and the journals were ranked according 
to these scores. The journals named by the ELT researchers were also 
among the journals with the highest impact factors. High impact factor of a 
journal indicates that the journal has a high citation percentage, which is 
widely accepted as an indication of the journal’s credibility (See Table 4)

The corpora of the PhDT and the RA introductions were parallel in 
terms of their dates and discourse types, which made a contrastive study of 
the main and the sub-categories possible. Both corpora involved texts 
reporting empirical studies publicized between the years 2001 and 2006. 
One exception was a research article that was published in 2007 in the 
TESOL Quarterly Journal, which was ranked as the most prestigious journal 
by the participants. No PhD thesis publicized in 2007 was available at the 
time when this thesis was being written.

3.2 Data Analyses 
 
 
This study employed both qualitative and quantitative data analyses 
methods, comprising frequency counts and text analyses of the PhD theses 
and the RA introductions. For instance, for the author presence markers, 
first the data were analyzed quantitatively by counting each instance of 
these markers in the two corpora. Then, the function of each marker was 
described qualitatively. The same procedure was followed in analyzing the 
move-step structure and also the citations in the two corpora.  
Before the analyses, the introduction parts of the PhD theses were 
compiled and saved electronically. Then, the same procedure was followed 
for the research articles. The documents that could not be reached 
electronically were scanned and edited for misprints before they could be 
electronically stored.  
The data were analyzed in two stages. The first stage was the computer-
supported analysis of the lexico-grammatical features of the research articles 
and the PhD theses.  In the second stage a hand-tagged analysis of the 
discoursal and rhetorical features of the texts was carried out.   
Two software programs for Windows were utilized in the computer 
supported analyses of the texts:  antconc3.1.303, a concordance software 
program developed by Laurence Anthony of Waseda University and WebVP 
(2.5), a vocabulary profiling software developed by Tom Cobb of the 
University of Quebec. Moreover, the readability statistics of the corpora 
were obtained by using the readability analysis feature of the Microsoft 
Word Program.  
antconc3.1.303 was used to form frequency lists, concordance lines and 
collocation patterns. WebVP (2.5), on the hand, was utilized in comparing 
the data with a corpus of K1 words (most frequent 1000 words), K2 (most 
frequent 1000 to 2000 words) and AWL (Academic Word Lists) words. 
This program compares data against the Academic Word List developed by 


## Page 63

 
48
Coxhead (2000) and British National Corpus in the analyses. Although these 
software programs can provide useful data about texts, they inherently have 
some drawbacks that are discussed extensively by Hancıoğlu and Eldridge 
(2007)  
These tools cannot for obvious reasons take into account the 
cognitive skills, and the background and cultural knowledge 
of individual readers, or those features which combine to 
make a text coherent and cohesive, such as reference words 
and discourse markers.   (331) 
 
Hancıoğlu and Eldrige (ibid.) also draw attention to the limitation of the 
readability analysis feature of Microsoft Word, which can solely recognize 
passives with the classic formula of “be + past participle” and which cannot 
detect reduced and adjectival passives.  
Taking these limitations of the computer-supported data corpus analyses 
tools into consideration, when possible, the findings were reevaluated in the 
light of the findings obtained through the hand-tagged analyses and the 
inferences were made cautiously in the discussion of the results.  
In the second stage, all sentence level analyses including the move-step 
structure, tense use, citations and author presence markers were conducted 
through the hand-tagged analyses. The moves in the corpora were identified 
and analyzed in the framework of the revised of the CARS Model (Swales, 
2004).  
An independent rater, a university lecturer holding MA in ELT, and who 
had a background in discourse analysis studies read the core articles and 
chapters related to the topic of this thesis and coded 20% of the cases in this 
study. There was over 80% agreement between the categorizations of the 
two raters. To solve the cases of disagreement, as Martinez (2005) applied 
in his study, a third rater, a PhD in ELT, who was not familiar with the 
categories was consulted and consensus was reached. Also, an intra-
reliability test by re-categorizing 20% of the cases 15 days after my initial 


## Page 64

 
49
categorization was executed. Except for minor variations between the first 
and second coding, there was more than 95% agreement between the first 
and second categorization.

CHAPTER IV 
RESULTS 
 
In this study, the first level of the analyses mainly focused on the lexico-
grammatical features of the two corpora. The second level of the analyses, 
which was the hand-tagged move structure analysis of the two corpora 
within the framework of Swales’ CARS Model (2005) was predominantly 
concerned with the discoursal and rhetorical features of the two corpora. 
However, in the course of the analyses, whenever possible, the two levels of 
analyses were carried out in an integrated fashion to increase the reliability 
of the findings. For instance, the concordancing tools produced a rather 
general pattern concerning the words and word strings in the two corpora. 
However, the hand tagged analysis of the words and word strings within the 
move-step analysis produced more focused and specialized frequency lists, 
such as the list of the most common words and word strings used in the 
move of “establishing the niche”.  In contrast, the computer supported 
vocabulary profiling of the corpora measured and compared the difficulty 
level of the language in the two corpora, which would not be possible solely 
through the hand-tagged move structure analyses.  
In reporting the significance level of the differences found out in the 
vocabulary profiling analyses of the two corpora, the two-proportion z-test 
feature of Minitab12, a statistical software package, was utilized. 
With respect to the research questions set at the beginning of the study, 
in this chapter, sections 4.1 and 4.2.1 focus on the lexico-grammatical 
features of the two corpora; namely these sections address the research 
questions 1.1, 1.2.2, 2.1, 2.2.2, 3.1. Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 report 
findings related to the discoursal features of the texts; these sections are 


## Page 66

 
51
specifically concerned with the research questions 1.2, 1.2.1, 2.2 and 2.2.1. 
In section 4.7 rhetorical features of the two corpora are described; namely, 
in this section the research questions 1.3, 2.3 and 3.3 are focused on.  
 
4.1 Lexico-Grammatical Features of the PhDT and the RA 
Introductions 
 
The RA introductions contained significantly (P-Value=0.000) less 
tokens per type (7.54) than the PhDT introductions (13.03) (See Table 5).  
Moreover, the RA introductions involved significantly (P-Value=0.000) less 
types per family (1.96) than the PhDT introductions (2.35). Also, the lexical 
density of the RA was more (P-Value=0.023, marginally significant) for the 
RAs (0.62) compared to the PhDTs (0.58).  These figures indicated that the 
authors of the RA introductions utilized a larger set of lexicon than the 
authors of the PhDTs. This also implied that the authors of the PhDT 
introductions preferred to repeat or cycle the words or made use of 
inflections and derivations more frequently than the authors of the RA 
introductions.

The vocabulary profiling of the two corpora revealed that RA 
introductions contained significantly (P-Value= 0.000) more AWL words 
(678, 12.75%), than the PhDT introductions(1246, 10.68%) (See Tables 6 
and 7). Moreover, the number of K2 words was also significantly (P-Value= 
0.000) more (663, 4.92%) in the RA introductions, compared to the PhDT 
introductions (247, 3.34%). However, the number of K1 words was 
significantly (P-Value= 0.000) more (1963, 75.08%) for the PhDT 
introductions, than for the RA introductions (1099, 69.78%). These figures 
indicated that the authors of the RA introductions tended to use less frequent 
words (K2 words) and more academic words (AWL words) more frequently 
compared to the authors of the PhDTs.

As far as the readability of the texts was concerned, the RA 
introductions contained significantly (P-Value= 0.000) more sentences per 
paragraph (4.9) compared to the number of sentences in the PHDT 
introductions (3.3) (See Table 8).  Moreover, the average number of words 
per sentence was significantly (P-Value= 0.000) more (29.7) in the RA 
introductions, compared to the number of words per sentence in the PhDT 
introductions (5.5). In addition, the average number of characters per word, 
which was 5.3 for the PhDT introductions, was 5.5 for the RA introductions. 
This difference was also found to be significant (P-Value= 0.000). Lastly, 
the number of passive structures was significantly (P-Value= 0.000) more in 
the RA introductions (29%) compared to the PHDT introductions (21%).  
These figures indicate that the RA introductions contained more passive 
structures, longer paragraphs, longer sentences and longer words than the 
PhDT introductions. Thus, the Flesch Reading Ease was found to be 
significantly (P-Value= 0.000)  less for the RA introductions (20.7), 
compared to the PhDT introductions (32.3), which means that the RA

introductions in this study were more difficult to read than the PhDT 
introductions.

The frequency lists obtained by using computer-supported corpus 
analyses tools provided a general idea about the most frequent content 
words, function words and word strings in the two sets of introductions. 
Tables 9-14 present (Appendix C) the most frequent 100 content words, 
function words and four-word strings in the RA and PhDT introductions. 
These lists were edited for the irrelevant off-list words such as proper nouns. 
More comprehensive, original versions can be seen in Appendices E-H. For 
the two corpora, the frequency lists of the function words contained almost 
the same set of items existing in almost in the same rank of frequency. 
However, these lists were not utilized as the primary source of reference for 
the description, comparison and categorization of the words included in the 
two corpora, since the articles and theses included in the corpora were not 
identical in terms of their content. Therefore, the data on these lists were 
integrated into the vocabulary profiling, readability statistics and the hand-


## Page 70

 
55
tagged analyses for the description, comparison and categorization of the 
words included in the two corpora.  
 
4.2  Move Structure of the RA and the PhDT Introductions 
 
  
 
The general Move-Step Structure Analysis (Swales, 2004) revealed that 
the three moves in the CARS Model, namely, M1, M2 and M3 existed in 
almost all of the research articles (See Table 14). In 23 out of 25 research 
articles, all three of these moves existed. However, only less than half of the 
PhDT introductions, 11 out of 25, contained all three of the moves. 
Specifically, the remaining 14 PhDT introductions did not contain a M2 
(See Table 15). Although the M1-M2-M3 was the most common pattern in 
the RA introductions, other configurations such as M3-M1-M2 or M1-M3-
M2 also occurred.  
In the M1-M2-M3 pattern of the CARS Model, the authors establish 
territory (M1), claim interest or importance by referring to other 
investigators and by providing citations. They also make topic 
generalizations by providing statements about knowledge or practice. 
In the second move (M2) of the M1-M2-M3 pattern, “establishing the 
niche”, the authors create a research space for their studies by either 
indicating a gap in their field of study (M2S1A), by adding to what is 
known (M2S1B) or by presenting positive justification for the approach in 
their own research study (M2S2).  
Following the two moves of the CARS Model (Swales, 2004), in the 
third move (M3) of the M1-M2-M3 pattern, the authors present their work 
by announcing their research descriptively. Moreover, in this move, they 
may present their research questions, hypotheses, clarify certain terms, 
announce principle outcomes, state the value of their research and outline 
the structure of the paper. However, as indicated by Swales (2004), these 
steps, except for “announcing the research descriptively” are optional.  


## Page 71

 
56
Thirteen out of 25 RA introductions in the corpus had the M1-M2-M3 
move structure pattern. In the remaining 12 RA introductions, there was a 
variety of different combinations, which made it hard to identify other 
patterns of frequent use. For instance, the M3- M1- M2 order occurred in 3 
of the RA introductions and the M1- M3- M2 pattern occurred only once in 
the RA introductions corpus.  
As far as the PhDT introductions were concerned, M1-M3 pattern was 
the most commonly preferred combination. In 9 out of 25 of the 
introductions, this pattern was employed without any cycling of the moves. 
In another 5 of the PhDT introductions, this move structure existed in a 
cycled fashion, M1-M3-M1-M3 being the most frequent pattern with 4 
instances of occurrence.  
As Tables 14, 15 indicate, cycling of the moves was a tendency for 
nearly half of the RA and the PhDT authors. In 10 out of 25 RA 
introductions, the three moves were cycled with a variety of different 
combinations. Similarly, in 12 out of 25 PhDT introductions, the moves 
were cycled. 
 As far as the cycled move units were concerned, excluding RA6 as an 
exception with 11 move  units, the number of move units in the RA 
introductions ranged between 4 to 7. This value was 4 to 5 for the PhDT 
introductions, in which PhDT20 was an exception with 10 move units (See 
Tables 15, 16).

Further analysis of the moves in the two corpora with particular 
concentration on the step patterns revealed that the two genres shared a 
number of similarities in the preferred use of the steps. First of all, in both 
corpora, the second move (establishing the niche) was actualized through 
S1A (indicating a gap). The exercise of S1B (adding to what is known) was 
the dispreferred option in both corpora. In the same way, S2 (presenting 
positive justification) was preferred by only two authors of the RA 
introductions. This option was not exercised at all in the PhDT 
introductions. (See Tables 17, 18) 
In addition to the steps within M2, the choice and frequency of steps in 
M3 (presenting the present work) were also quite parallel in the two 
corpora. As also indicated by Swales (2004) in the CARS Model, all of the 
RA and PhDT introductions contained the first step, S1(announcing present 
research descriptively) in the third move, (presenting the present work).  
The least common steps were S3 (definitional clarifications) labeled as 
optional in the CARS Model and S5 (announcing principle outcomes) 
labeled as PSIF (probable in some fields, but unlikely in others). In fact, 
except for S1 and S4 (summarizing methods), the other steps S2, S3, S5, S6 
and S7 were used systematically neither in the PhDT introductions, nor in 
the RA introductions. The use of these steps did not exceed 8 instances in 
both corpora. However, it should be noted that only S6 (stating the value of 
the present research) was found to be a slightly more common option for the 
authors of the RA introductions.  
The analysis also revealed that the authors of both corpora utilized the 
steps in the third move in a variety of combinations and configurations. 
Thus, a general pattern in the use of steps for the third move (presenting the 
present work) was hard to identify for the introductions analyzed in this 
study.

4.2.1 Move Structure of the PhDT Introductions 
 
The Move-Step Analysis (Swales, 2004) conducted so far confirmed 
Swales’ (2004) description of the move structure for the RA. However, 
Swales’ CARS Model did not completely account for the PhDT 
introductions analyzed in this study in several aspects, which resulted in the 
revision of the CARS Model to make it more compatible with the PhDTs 
introductions. In the course of the revision, moves and steps with 


## Page 78

 
63
frequencies less than 25 (the total number of theses in the corpus) were 
regarded as “optional”.  
The first aspect subject to revision concerned two additional steps for 
Move 1 (establishing a territory). More than half (15 out of 25) of the 
introductions contained definition of one or more terms in M1. In most 
cases, this definition was integrated into the first move regardless of the 
existence of a “definition of terms” section in the third move (presenting the 
present work) (See Figure 9).  
 More than half of the PhDT introductions (14 out of 25) did not contain 
a M2 (indicating a gap).  Most of the authors of the PhDT introductions did 
not tend to establish a niche in the research done previously. Instead, within 
Move 1, after establishing the territory, with increasing specificity, the 
authors (21 out of 25) tended to focus on the need for conducting their 
study. This need was in the form of a specific, local problem that motivated 
the author to conduct the study rather than an observed niche in the previous 
research. In 15 of the introductions, this step also existed under the sub-
headings “The Problem” or “Problem Statement” or “Statement of the 
Problem” (See Tables 19, 20).

Excerpts 1-13 are examples of Step 3, description of the local problem 
that led to the study. The problems discussed by the authors can be grouped 
in three categories.  
The first category contains problems that are discussed to pinpoint a 
“problem” in language teaching in the national-level. Excerpts 1-7 are 
examples of such problems discussed in M1S3 of the PhDT introductions.  
(1) 
For years and years, foreign language has been intensively 
taught in Turkey both as a second language and as a medium 
of instruction. Nevertheless, teachers throughout the country 
have been complaining about their students' lack of 
communicative skills in English and their unwillingness to 
participate in any sort of discussion in the class. Why, then, 
one might ask, cannot the particular demands of learners of 
English still be satisfied whereas they are actively involved in 
language learning at almost all level of their training?…  
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
(PhDT19, 8) 
 


## Page 83

(2) 
However, since many language teachers and language 
teaching schools have not paid attention to the teaching of 
pronunciation until recently, English language teaching 
programs (especially those in private language teaching 
schools) in our country have become partially successful at 
producing fluent and accurate speakers of English, yet 
unintelligible speakers of English. This is, in fact, owing to 
the English teachers' lack of knowledge in phonetics and 
phonology.…  
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
 
 (PhDT10, 3) 
 
 
(3) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is a fact that English is one of the most important foreign 
languages taught at all levels of the educational system in 
Turkey. A great deal of effort and money has been spent in 
order to teach it effectively to Turkish students by both 
parents and the government…. Although the learners, the 
parents and the government are conscious of this 
phenomenon, the intended goals cannot be obtained 
adequately. One of the causes of this failure at the 
elementary education can be the course books followed and 
teaching activities they involve. 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
 
(PhDT2, 2) 
(4) 
 
 
In our present education system, most teachers do not seem to 
be equipped with the necessary skills to educate and prepare 
future generations for the twenty-first century, the era of 
knowledge. In order to help our students to compete with the 
citizens of other developed countries in the field of knowledge

and advanced technology, they must be properly educated to 
fully utilize higher order thinking skills and hence become 
critical thinkers. …Although we know that critical thinking is 
more important than rote memorization, not many teachers 
tend to teach critical thinking skills in their classes. As a result, 
our students lack learning the skills of questioning, 
researching, analyzing, interpreting and the like since we do 
not teach them how to process information….. 
 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
 
 
(PHDT9, 4) 
(5) 
This is also true of the majority of the Turkish EFL students who 
ostensibly have difficulty in using language for practical 
purposes when they have a message to get across. … 
Although the aforementioned needs are so pressing and 
English is considered so important a subject in language 
education of Turkey, traditional EFL teaching methods and 
curriculum designers have been seriously disconnected from 
the rapid development of ideas underlying communicative 
language teaching. 
Since most Turkish students' oral performance after six years 
of studying English  is unsatisfactory, the effectiveness of 
their learning to speak English by memorising grammatical 
rules is seriously in doubt.… 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
 
 
(PHDT20, 4-5) 
 
(6) 
…The many faculties of education in Turkey are addressing 
this need and training English language teachers, yet there is 
no specific training for the trainers; that is to say, trainer 
training is a field all on its own but, unfortunately, there is no 
faculty or school that directly addresses this particular issue.

Taking into consideration the popularity and the widespread 
use of communicative tasks in EFL coursebooks and 
classrooms in a variety of educational institutions including 
preparatory schools at the level of higher education in 
Turkey, there arises a need to investigate nature of the 
teachers" and learners’  perceptions of communicative tasks in 
EFL settings at this level. 
 
 
(PHDT7, 6) 
 
The second category concerns problems in the institutional level. The 
problems discussed in excerpts 8-12 belong to this category.

Regarding the less proficiency gains, students attending 
Eskişehir Anadolu University, Turkey can be a good 
example…. Observations show that even intermediate level 
students make errors in most grammatical structures. …

For the past semesters, university supervisors have reported 
that the reflective papers that the student teachers wrote 
have been similar to narrative descriptions of events without 
any attempt to reflect critically about those events. …

What's more, each university comes up with its own syllabi 
led by self-determined course objectives, so a variety of 
materials are being used for a variety of reasons, which 
means 'there is not a standard course book, either. …

Bilkent University School of English Language, as 
mentioned previously, is an institution that offers training 
and development opportunities for all the teachers in the 
institution….. Hence, since there are a number of courses 
run every year, there is a need to maintain a standard 
across the institution with regard to effective training 
sessions and the qualities of good trainers. … 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
 
(PHDT23, 10) 
The last category is about a personal drive or interest that motivates the 
author to conduct the study (See excerpts 13 and 14).  
  
 
 
(13) 
After teaching English at different levels for eight years, the 
researcher has noticed that even the students with high 
proficiency levels have some fears that affect their 
performances in language classes. Informal interviews of the 
researcher with students have shown that most of the students 
are affected from an apprehension about language….

A Turkish Cypriot, I, grew up in a family where my father 
was a true bilingual in Turkish and Greek and proficient in 
English. …Moreover, everybody around me both educated 
and uneducated can speak some English, and some of them 
even some Greek. Therefore, I felt the need to understand the 
language situation in Cyprus and how it evolved.

The third move (presenting the present research) was also revised in a 
way to account for the steps that were preferred or dispreferred by the 
authors of the PhDT introductions (See Table 21). There were mainly two 
steps that were non-existent in the RA introductions, but that were 
frequently used in the PhDT introductions. These were: stating assumptions, 
stating limitations and stating the scope of the study.  These steps were 
added to the list of the optional steps in Move 3 (See Figure 8).   
Each of these steps was used in more than half of the 25 introductions.  
Limitations and scope of the study were stated in 18 of the introductions and 
the authors stated their assumptions  in 15 of their introductions. In some of 
the introductions these steps were made explicit  also through sub-headings 
(See Tables 19, 20). However, as far as the sub-headings “the limitations” 
and “the scope” were concerned, the distinction between the two was most 
of the time blurred. Therefore, in the move-structure model, the two were 
indicated as one single step, Step 6 (Stating the limitations/scope of the 
study).  
“Stating the assumptions” was another step that was unique to the PhDT 
introductions. In this step, the author, in a proactive fashion eliminated 


## Page 88

 
73
possible questions or criticisms that would have a negative impact on the 
reliability of the methods, research tools or validity of the findings.  For 
instance in Excerpt 15, the author assumes that short stories are valuable and 
suitable authentic tools for language classes, before s/he conducts a study to 
revise a course that aims to teach English through short stories. Similarly, in 
Excerpt 16 the author assumes that the students who participated in the 
study answered the items on the inventories carefully and accurately.  
Excerpts 15-21 are some of the examples of Step 4, “stating assumptions”.  
 
 (15) 
In the course of this study the following assumptions will be 
undertaken: 
 
Literary texts are valuable authentic sources for both 
teachers and teacher trainees. 
 
Short stories are potentially suitable texts to be used for both 
training and teaching purposes in EFL, ESL, and English as 
the mother tongue context. …

There are two assumptions in this study. These are displayed 
as follows: 
1. It is more likely than not that the learners have a different 
perception of language and learning from the teachers…. 
2. Communicative tasks are an area where a potential 
mismatch 
between 
teacher 
intention 
and 
learner 
interpretation occurs, as revealed by Kumaravadivelu 
(1991) and Breen(1987).

1.   The sample is large enough to represent the population. 
2. It is assumed that all the statements and questions were 
answered sincerely and correctly by students, parents and 
teachers.

In the course of the study, the following assumptions will be 
undertaken: 
… 
3) In foreign language teaching, the teaching activities are 
a very important part of the teaching process, and should 
cover the needs of the learners. 
.... 
4) The questionnaire designed for the study to collect the 
data is valid and reliable. It is also assumed that the 
responses to this questionnaire reflect the real and sincere 
opinions of the participants.

Both the limitations and the scope of the study concerned the factors that 
decreased the generalizability power of the findings. The authors expressed 
their reservations in claiming that the findings in their study could be 
applicable to other contexts. There is a subtle difference in the meanings of 
two concepts “scope” and “limitation”, although used interchangeably by 
some of the authors in this study.  In talking about the “scope”, the authors 
emphasized the general aim of the study and stated that their study does not 
want to investigate issues beyond that stated aim. Excerpts 22-24 are 
examples of such instances.  However, the limitations were more concerned 


## Page 91

 
76
with the research methods such as the quality or quantity of subjects, data, 
the research tools or data analyses methods and the factors. In excerpts 25-
36, the authors state the limitations as regards their research studies.  
In the categorization of the excerpts, the sub-headings used in the 
introductions were disregarded, since not all authors preferred to use sub-
headings. Moreover, the sub-headings in some cases did not account for the 
move or the step as defined in the CARS Model (Swales, 2004).  
 
(22) 
The scope of this research covers 100 vocational freshman 
and/or sophomore students studying Engineering, Fine arts, 
Business 
Administration, 
Economics, 
Education 
and 
Humanities and Letters at Bilkent University where the 
medium of instruction is English. …The following factors 
will not be taken into consideration throughout the study: 
1. Motivation 
… 
This study will not concentrate on the students who are 
novice, elementary or intermediate level students who study 
at Bilkent Preparatory Program.  
… 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
(PhDT12, 8-9) 
(23) 
 
In the study, there is a constraint related to the scope of the 
study, which constitutes the second limitation. The study is 
concerned with teachers' and students' perceptions of the 
effectiveness of the four types of communicative tasks in the 


## Page 92

ELT coursebook called Language in Use Intermediate 
Classroom Book by Doff & Jones (1994). aiming at 
improving the oral language skills of students in the 
elementary and intermediate group classes at the DBE. METU 
-planned, unplanned, open and closed tasks. Hence, the 
communicative tasks in the coursebooks dealing with the 
reading and writing skills in both groups' programs are 
beyond the scope of this study. 
 
(PhDT7, 13-14) 
(24) 
Williams and Burden (1997) state that learners bring to the 
task of learning various characteristics such as age, gender, 
personality, motivation, self-concept, life experience, and 
cultural background, all of which influence the way they 
learn. They claim that individuals construct their own 
meaning from their own learning. However, these 
extraneous variables are not taken into account in this study 
since they do not constitute the main focus of this study. 
(PhDT17, 42) 
 
(25) 
The limitations of this study is that only the teachers and 
trainers at Bilkent University are given the questionnaires.  
….. Therefore, the results may not be generalisable to other 
institutions. …Since the researcher had three groups of 
informants, only the data collected from the ICELT teachers 
and the DELTA teachers could be analysed through the chi-
square….  
 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
(PhDT23, 11) 
(26) 
To begin with, as the aim is to suggest a syllabus, it is inevitable to 
search for the real inspiration, beliefs, and viewpoints which 
caused YÖK to introduce a short story course at ELT departments. 


## Page 93

 
78
However, YOK cannot offer much help because the World Bank 
did not leave any documents behind after the project completed. 
… 
Secondly, appearing first in the 19th century, modern short story is 
one of the newest genres, but it can still offer a vast amount of 
examples….. Similarly, the literature offers a great deal on short 
story analysis but not much on teaching. … 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
(PhDT22, 5) 
(27) 
The findings of this study are limited to the group of students 
who study English at Bilkent University First Year English 
Program in five different faculties which are; Economics, 
Engineering, Business Administration, Art -Design - 
architecture and Humanities and Letters….. Though the 
findings would not be applicable and could not be 
generalized to the entire university population, subjects from 
five different faculties provide the readers a further 
understanding and spectrum of what the general picture 
about this subject can be at the university level. Moreover, 
because of certain limitations and privacy issues, which 
personality type is successful in which language skill 
(reading, writing, listening, and speaking) could not be 
tested. 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
(PhDT12, 10) 
(28) 
There are several limitations in the study. …Only the 
participants from the DBK took part in the study. The total 
number of students and teachers in the study was 91 and 16 
respectively. Administrative constraints rendered it hard to 
enlarge the size of the sample in the study by including 
participants from other departments of METU or from other 
universities. … 
The final limitation in the study is concerned with the number 
of the communicative tasks in the study. Due to the time 
constraint in the study only eight tasks were subjected to the 
quantitative and qualitative analysis. 


## Page 94

 
79
All the limitations mentioned above might have a restricting 
impact on the study. It is nevertheless, believed that the 
research will still yield valid and reliable findings as a result 
of certain variables being controlled, the use of two different 
groups of participants, as well as reliable data collection 
methods. 
 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
 
(PhDT7, 13-14) 
(29) 
 
 
The first limitation to the study is that the subjects' attitude 
towards learning English as a second language may be 
different from the other learners since the subjects of this 
study will be English teachers after they complete their 
undergraduate education. For that reason, the results of 
the study may not represent all the students that are 
learners of a second language. Another limitation is that the 
number of the population may not represent all the students 
of the ELT Departments at the Education Faculties in 
Turkey. 
(PhDT3, 6) 
(30) 
 
Apart from delimitation of time and resources, the study is 
limited to the third-year students at the ELT Department of  
Çukurova University. …The applicability of the results to 
other ELT departments may need further study to make a 
sound generalization. 
 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
 
 
(PhDT16, 13) 
(31) 
 
An important limitation of this study is that only 
certain grammatical constructions such as phrases, clauses 
or embedded sentences are taken into consideration to be 
analyzed in writing, not all the grammatical constituents in 
English (see Appendix 16). 
The students' previous writing experiences are not 
taken into account. …

The research centers on "K - 12 Grades" DoDDS students and 
is designed to illuminate practices at DoDDS Turkey District 
including the schools located in Ankara, Izmir and Adana. 
The research does not include the other Mediterranean 
schools in Bahrain, Spain, Greece. Italy, etc. The sample 
population includes only the "K. - 12 Grade Students" in 
Ankara, Izmir and Adana. Kindergarten students are 
selected for the research, too.

The scope of the study is given below: 
1- Individual differences are not taken into account. 
… 
2- In this study, input is controlled, not spontaneous. In the 
future studies, spontaneous input can be used by adding oral 
tasks.

…The student- teachers were asked whether or not and how 
their mentors had influenced them. However, this aspect was 
not explored in an in-depth manner…. Appointments with the 
participants for the first and the second rep-grid applications 
were arranged.   For each contact, contact summary sheets 
were filled (see Appendix C). All these procedures were rather 
occupying, and made it impossible to work with a larger 
population.  A greater number of participants would have let 
the researcher have a broader frame of the happenings, 
which might make the study findings more generalisable. 
However, in this study, the amount of data to be collected 
made it impossible.

 (PhDT6, 7-8) 
 
 
In addition to the revisions made in the first, second and third moves, the 
way the moves and the steps were cycled also had to be revised for the 
PhDT introductions. Since the cycling of the moves and steps was more 
frequent for the PhDT introductions, more arrows indicating the direction of 
the flow were placed on the CARS Model (See Figure 8). 
Lastly, Step 5 (announcing principle outcomes) was totally removed 
from in the revised CARS Model (Swales, 2004) for the PhD theses since 
this step existed in only one of the analyzed introductions (See Figure 8).

4.3 Ways of Establishing the Niche in the RA and the PhDT 
       Introductions 
 
The general Move-Step Structure Analysis (Swales, 2004) revealed that 
the three moves in the CARS Model, namely, M1, M2 and M3 existed in 
almost all of the research articles. In 23 out of 25 research articles, all three 
of these moves existed. However, only less than half of the PhDT 
introductions, 11 out of 25, contained all three of the moves. Specifically, 
the remaining 14 introductions in the PhDT corpus although contained M1 
and M3, did not contain a M2. Thus, M2, establishing the niche, was the 


## Page 98

 
83
most important discoursal element that marked the variations in the move 
structure of the RA and the PhDT introductions analyzed in this study.  
Table 22 provides a brief comparison of the frequency of each 
establishing the niche key signal (Swales, 1990) for the RA and the PhDT 
introductions. These key signals are presented in their full context in 
excerpts 35-107 in Appendix D. For both the RA and the PhDT 
introductions, “establishing the niche in the previous studies through 
negative or quasi negative quantifiers” was the most common option, which 
is followed by “lexical negation”. As Table 22 also indicates, for the authors 
of the RA introductions, contrastive comments were the third most 
commonly preferred way of establishing the niche. In the PhDT 
introductions, however, the most common third option was negation in the 
verb phrase. Table 23 presents the type and frequency of the key signals in 
the RA and PhDT introductions.

4.4 Citations 
 
In the corpus of the PhDT introductions comprising 2963 sentences, the 
authors referred to 413 different sources.  In other words, around 20% of the 
statements was attributed to a source. For the RA introductions consisting of 
556 statements, 426 different sources were attributed by the authors. This 
means that the authors referred to a source in 76.6% of the statements in the 
corpus. To put it differently, the authors of the RAs made reference to a 
source in every 1.3 sentences of their introductions, while this ratio was one 
in every 7 sentences in the PhDT introductions.   
The analysis of the citations, namely, the distribution of the integral, non-
integral, reporting and non-reporting citations (Swales, 1990), indicated 
significant differences also in the way the authors of the RA and the PhDT 
introductions made reference to previous research. The frequency of each 
citation type, the authors’ repertoire of reporting verbs and their choice of 
tense in their citations signaled dissimilarities.  
The authors of the RA introductions preferred non-integral and non-
reporting citations. The authors of the PhDT introductions, on the other hand, 
preferred integral and non- reporting citations.   
Out of a total of 180 citation statements in the RA introductions, 68 
(37.7%) were integral. In the corpus of PhDT introductions, however, 286 
(62.2%) of a total of 459 citation statements were integral. Moreover, 80 
(44.4%) of a total of 180 citation statements in the corpus of RA 
introductions were reporting. Nevertheless, this was a much less frequent 
option, 110 (23.9%), in the PhDT introductions which contained 459 citation 
statements (See Figure 10).

The reporting verbs used in the citations in the two corpora did not 
signal extensive variations (See Tables 24-27). The authors of the PhDT 
introductions used the same set of reporting words with authors of the RA 
introductions. However, the authors of the RA introductions used the verbs 
in more variety (52 different verbs in 86 reporting verbs), compared to the 
authors of the PhDT introductions (42 different verbs in 89 reporting verbs).

The analyses of the citations in the two corpora revealed two other 
aspects of dissimilarity in the way the authors cited from other sources. The 
authors of the PhDT introductions had a remarkable tendency in exercising 
secondary citation in their introductions. Fifty-nine of the 413 sources 


## Page 108

 
93
(14.2%) were cited from other sources and were marked with the string 
“cited in” or “in” with the original source (See excerpts 108-111). This 
tendency was not found to be significant for the RAs (less than 3 percent). 
The other dissimilarity concerned the frequency of explicit quotations.  In 
the corpus of the RA introductions, only 4 (5%) out of 180 citations were 
explicit quotations. This was 67 (14.5%) in the  corpus of the PhDT 
introductions which contained a total of 459 citation statements (See 
Excerpt 112).  
 
(108) 
 
For example, student- teachers' ideologies are resistant to 
change (Zeichner and Liston in Ulla, Peltokallio and Paivi, 
2000).  
(PhDT6, 4) 
(109) 
Initially, formal English grammar instruction was 
considered as a means to improve the written compositions 
of students because of the teacher's intuitive sense that 
somehow and somewhere there was a relationship between 
mastery of grammar and effective writing (O'Hare cited in 
Laframboise, 1989, p. 24).

characteristic patterns as behaviour, thoughts, and feelings."

(111) 
Among the many aspects of language and society 
interaction that  sociolinguistics  targets  as  its  research  
agenda  has been the "systematic covariance of linguistic 
structure and social structure" (Bright cited in Haugen, 


## Page 109

 
94
1987, p. 48) and as Haugen (1987) puts it "diversity and 
uniformity" (p. 48) in the language behaviour of a society. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(PhDT18, 5) 
(112) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this respect, Gardner states: 
There are important reasons for considering the theory of 
Multiple Intelligences and its implications for education. First of 
all, it is clear that many talents, if not intelligences, are 
overlooked nowadays; individuals with these talents are the chief 
casualties of the single-minded, single funneled approach to the 
mind. There are many unfilled and poorly filled niches in society 
and it would be an opportunity to guide individuals with the right 
set of abilities to these billets (1991: 164). 
 
(PhDT12, 5) 
4.5 Verb Tenses in the RA and the PhDT Introductions 
 
The frequency count of the occurrence of the verb tenses in the two 
corpora revealed a fairly similar pattern for the PhDT and RA introductions 
as far as the tense choice and frequency were concerned. As Figures 11 and 
12 indicate, the most frequent tense was the Simple Present Tense in both 
corpora.  In both corpora, Simple Present Tense was followed by Simple 
Past Tense and Present Perfect Tense. However, the distribution of the 
tenses was found to be more even for the RA introductions. 
In the corpus of the PhDT introductions, 2750 (86%) out of 3196 
sentences were in the Simple Present Tense. The remaining sentences were 
in the Simple Past Tense (243, 8%), Present Perfect Tense (138, 4%), Future 
Tense (64, 2%) and in the Present Continuous Tense (7 sentences).  For the 
RA introductions, however, out of 556 sentences, 328 (60%) were in the 
Simple Present Tense. The remaining 228 sentences contained 108 (19%) 
sentences in the Simple Past Tense, 85 (15%) in the Present Perfect Tense, 
27 (5%) in the Future Tense and 8 (1%) in the Past Perfect Tense.

The analysis of the frequency of the tenses within each move indicated 
that the moves and steps in both corpora were marked with the predominant 
use of certain tenses (see Tables 28, 29).  In general, in line with the 
percentages indicated in Tables 25 and 26 Simple Present Tense was 
predominantly preferred by the authors of both corpora in all three moves 
and Simple Past Tense was the second most frequently preferred tense. The 
only exception was the step of “summarizing methods” within the third 
move (step 3 in the PhDTs and Step 4 in RAs), which is in the Simple Past 
Tense in both corpora.  
However, as far as the second step, presenting research questions and/or 
hypotheses, was considered, the authors of the PhDT and the RA 
introductions preferred different tenses. The second step within the third 
move, presenting research questions and/or hypotheses, was in Simple 
Present Tense in the PhDT introductions (100%). However, for the RA 
introductions, the research questions and/or hypotheses were in most cases 
in Simple Past Tense (15 out of the 25 Step 2 sentences).

4.6 Presenting the Present Work- Author’s Claim in Move 3 
 
According to Swales (1990) and Myers (1985), the verbs used in 
reporting research signal the degree of author’s commitment and claim 
about the research presented. For instance, the use of some verbs like show, 
demonstrate or establish asserts the author’s high-level claims about the 
research, while others like suggest, propose or examine signal low-level 
claims. The analyses of the verbs used in presenting research produced no 
significant variations in the level of the authors’ claims and commitment 
(See Tables 30, 31).  
The only variation concerned the number and variety of the verbs used 
by the authors. The authors of the RA introductions used relatively more 
verbs than the authors of the PhDT introductions when presenting their 
research. In the corpus of RA introductions, the authors presented their 
research in 79 instances by using 40 different verbs. However, the authors of 
the PhDT introductions used 28 different verbs in 63 instances. This meant 
that 50.63% of the verbs in the RA corpus were used only once, while this 
ratio was 44.44% in the PhDT corpus (See table 32).

4.7 Author Presence Markers in the RA and the PhDT Introductions 
 
The ways in which the authors of PhDTs and RAs indicated their 
presence in the introductions showed variations. In 18 of the 25 RA 
introductions, the authors used the personal pronouns I and/or we. As far as 
the ways the authors of the RA introductions used I and we were considered, 
the most common function (in 10 out of 18 RA introductions in which the 
personal pronouns were used) was “expressing the procedural soundness 
and uniqueness of the research”, which is a self-promotional strategy 
according to Harwood (2005).  Excerpts 113- 124 provide the contexts in 
which the pronouns I and we were used in the RA introductions.  
 
(113) 
 
(As the subjects did not learn the material taught to them 
satisfactorily in the study by Sanchez (2002), it was thought 
that it would be wise to teach learners in a different way. 
The instruction of the concepts, following the hints provided 
by the data collected in the study we have already referred 
to, was carried out with the features and links shown by 
native subjects and not with those that language teachers 
normally use in language classrooms to facilitate learning 
and 
student 
comprehension 
(e.g. 
the 
classifications 
established for the semantic field Light, Faber and Perez, 
1993) 
(RA3, 90)

The instruction of the concepts, following the hints provided 
by the data collected in the study we have already referred

native subjects and not with those that language teachers 
normally use in language classrooms to facilitate learning 
and 
student 
comprehension 
(e.g. 
the 
classifications 
established for the semantic field Light, Faber and Perez, 
1993). For this research we took several measures, in fact 
the same dependent variables used in Sanchez's study 
(2002): lexical test, proximity (relatedness ratings), distance 
(minimum distance between the nodes in a network) and 
similarity (similarity between networks).. 
(RA3, 90) 
(115) 
We make a proposal for teaching reading comprehension in 
a non-native language based on the exploitation of text 
structure, making our readers aware of and capable of 
interpreting the rhetorical information a text presents. 
(116) 
Our exploitation of text structure as a tool to improve 
reading comprehension is part of an approach to the 
teaching of reading comprehension, the ultimate objective of 
which is to make readers capable of an intentional 
processing based on the adequate and effective use of two 
types of knowledge depending on the reading situation they 
face: the first, knowledge of semantic relations, that is, how 
sentences may be joined by comparison, causality, etc., or 
how paragraphs may express two contrasting ideas, and the 
second, knowledge of the way these relations are manifested 
in the text, in other words the lexical, syntactic resources the 
foreign language employs to express them. 
(RA10, 81, 83) 
 
 
(117) 
 
We 
distinguish 
between 
top-level 
and 
bottom-level 
comprehension to study which cues to meaning learners use. 
Consistent with this view of reading, we follow a type of 
analysis of discourse structure which looks into discourse 
structure from the point of view of the reader, trying to 


## Page 124

 
109
detect in the surface structure of discourse the elements 
which allow the reader to interpret text. 
 
(RA10, 81, 83) 
 
 
(118) 
We analyse the effect of structure (the rhetorical 
organization of expository prose) on EFL reading 
performance through the study of the relation between use of 
structure, on the one hand, and comprehension and 
reproduction of information, on the other. This approach 
will give us information about the use our readers make of 
structure and the effect it has on their reading. 
 
(RA10, 81, 83) 
(119) 
 
 
In the following account, I compare two undergraduate 
writing task surveys carried out in the United States and in 
Hong Kong. I consider the first a success and the second a 
failure. In an attempt to determine why the second failed, I 
will describe and analyze the approach used in each context. 
Because the cooperation of teachers from other disciplines is 
vital to the success of EAP research, I will also discuss 
possible reasons for the lack of cooperation from the 
teachers in the second study.  (M3, S1, S7)  
 
(RA10, 293-294) 
(120) 
To begin with, I will contextualize the study of language 
memoirs by situating them within a rich tradition of 
American cross-cultural autobiography. Then, I will explore 
the possibilities and limitations of the use of cross-cultural 
autobiographies for the study of gender in SLA. 
(RA12,  212) 
 
(121) 
I will argue that approaching language memoirs as 
discursive constructions, rather than as factual statements, 
has great potential for the field of applied linguistics, 
(M3S4) 
 


## Page 125

 
110
(RA12,  212) 
(122) 
 
However, I will develop this argument by first looking at the 
problem of meaning in relation to criteria for coding 
'corrective recasts'. Thus, in the next two sections of this 
paper, I will empirically demonstrate, through the analysis 
of segments of interaction which include turns that I believe 
could be coded as 'corrective recasts', that the theory of 
meaning implicit in the coding criteria is problematic. 
 
…In addition, my description of a turn as containing non-
target-like language is based on my own intuition as a 
proficient speaker of English and is thoroughly etic, as it is 
not based on participants' orientation to the turn as deviant 
and/or problematic. 
 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C) 
 
(RA21, 293-295) 
(123) 
 
By this I do not mean to suggest that it is only in 'remedial' 
sequences that the participants orient to differences in 
linguistic expertise, but such orientations were especially 
salient in this type of sequence. In the next section, therefore, 
I will briefly review the notions of repair and correction in 
CA 
(RA15, 646) 
 
(124) 
 
Through the use of think-aloud protocols, I obtained 
evidence about the strategies and knowledge sources 
learners rely on during the inferencing process. 
 
(RA15, 646) 
  
Another function of the personal pronouns used in the RA introductions 
(in 8 out of 18 RA introductions in which the personal pronouns were used) 
was “personalizing claims” which is also a self-promotional strategy 
according to Harwood (2005) (See excerpts 125-128). The authors use the 
personal pronouns I and we to persuade the reader that the authors, like the 


## Page 126

 
111
claim they are putting forward are worth taking notice of. Some examples of 
this function are as follows: 
 
 
 
(125) 
 
Bilmes (1986) argues that this commonsense theory of 
meaning is implicit in much sociological theory. I would add 
that it is also implicit in the criteria often presented in 
research reports as instructions for coding particular turn s 
as 'corrective recasts' 
(RA21, 293-295) 
(126) 
My findings may also have wider implications for content 
lecturers and ESP specialists in other second language 
contexts and disciplines. 
(RA5, 66) 
(127) 
 
Although the study reported below adopts the same 
analytical stance as Nishizaka (1999) and Mori (2003), 
there are two notable differences between their studies and 
mine. 
(RA22, 26) 
 
(128) 
For some time, now, I have felt that this way of looking at 
vocabulary attrition is an unsatisfactory one. (M2) 
It seems to me, however, that the work reported in the 
previous paragraph does not really take the implications of 
the network idea seriously. (M2) 
 
 
(RA16, 137) 
 
There was only one instance in the corpus of RA introductions in which 
the personal pronoun I was used for the purpose of organizing the text and 
guiding the reader through the argument. (Hyland, 2001) (See excerpt 129) 
 
 
(129)

After reviewing relevant CR research and analyzing the 
approach adopted in the course, I will examine the 
differences in students' essays written before and after the 
course, focusing on, in this case, a culturally based element: 
the thesis statement. 
 
(RA14, 214) 
 
 
 
As opposed to the authors of the RA introductions, the authors of the 
PhDT introductions did not tend to mark their presence in their 
introductions. In only 10 out of 25 introductions, the authors preferred to be 
visible.  In these 10 introductions, there were 20 instances in which author 
presence was marked.  
I and we seemed to be systematically avoided by the authors of the 
PhDT introductions. In only 2 cases in which author presence was marked, 
the pronoun I was used. In Excerpt 144,  We—Prof. Ekmekci and I is used as 
the agent of the statement. This is the only example of a case in which the 
author of the PhDT thesis speaks on behalf of the supervisor of the thesis 
and makes a joint claim. We  was used in two other PhDT introductions.   In 
the remaining 16 instances “the researcher”, “this researcher” and “this 
author” were used by the authors to mark their presence in the text (See 
excerpts 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 140, 148, 149) 
The authors of the PhDT introductions marked their presence in the text 
for several different purposes. However, in contrast with the RA 
introductions, none of these instances were examples of promotional use of 
personal pronouns (Harwood, 2005).  
 In 8 of the 20 instances in which the author presence was marked, the 
rhetorical function of the statement was to recount experimental procedure 
and methodology (Hyland, 2001) ( See excerpts 130-137).

The researcher together with four other members of the 
Testing Office of the School of Foreign Languages of 
Boğaziçi University worked to produce test specifications 
and several test versions following a certain reading model 
under the supervision of Professor Cyril Weir with the 
support of the British Council, Istanbul. 
(PhDT15, 5) 
(131) 
The researcher assigned ELT 1.02 as the control group and 
ELT 1.03 as the experimental group. 
(PhDT10, 6) 
(132) 
 
After selecting the data collection instruments, the 
researcher got the necessary permission from the head of the 
Department to conduct the research. 
 
(PhDT10, 8) 
(133) 
 
After the data were collected at the beginning of the Spring 
Semester of 2001-2002 Academic Year (Pretest), the 
researcher listened to the recordings many times and wrote 
the impressionistic transcriptions of the words with 
problematic consonants and vowels on the tables previously 
drawn for the determination of the problematic segmental 
English phonemes for Turkish learners of English. 
 
(PhDT10, 9) 
(134) 
 
The researcher used Demirezen's (1987) coursebook entitled 
Articulatory Phonetics and Principles of Sound Production; 
such books Ship and Sheep, Three and Tree are also used as 
workshop materials. 
(PhDT10, 10) 
(135) 
The researcher recorded eighty-eight subjects' voices as 
they read aloud a short story ("The Chaser") and two 
dialogues in the language laboratory of the ELT Department 
of Hacettepe University again

Self-development in the area of presentation style using action 
research and reflection were selected because this researcher 
participated in the study; thus, a case study was not an option. 
 
(PhDT11, 17) 
(137) 
 
Since the researcher had three groups of informants, only 
the data collected from the ICELT teachers and the DELTA 
teachers could be analysed through the chi-square. As the 
number of  the ICELT teachers was 42 and the DELTA 
teachers 14 chi-square analysis could easily be done. 
 
(PhDT23, 12) 
 
In 4 of the 20 instances in which author presence was marked, the 
authors stated their personal opinions and knowledge claims (See excerpts 
138-140) 
 
(138) 
 
We strongly believe that if translation courses are carried out 
systematically, students can make connection with other 
lessons. 
 
(PhDT16, 6) 
(139) 
 
In this author's opinion, the answer to that question 
depends on the teacher and the students in the class. 
(PhDT17, 21) 
(140) 
 
 
 
However, if a rule of thumb is desirable, this author 
believes that in the ideal language class some culture is 
included in every regular class. 
 
(PhDT17, 21) 
(141)

In other words, it has not been specially gained in writing 
curricula (First, 1995). We—Prof. Ekmekci and I—believe, 
as Gaims and Redman (1986) also state, this is an extremely 
important area in teaching a foreign language (FL), and 
unless this kind of technique is integrated, contextual 
establishment of text may become almost impossible (p.71). 
 
(PhDT14, 4) 
(142) 
 
Carrying out such an investigation has made us aware of the 
issues involved. 
 
(PhDT19, 10) 
In 3 of the 20 instances, the authors described the situation that lead 
them to conduct their studies (See excerpts 143-145) 
(143) 
In parallel to this concrete evidence, the researcher 
himself has observed a likewise case at his own department 
which is a four-year teacher-training program where 
prospective English teachers are trained for secondary 
education.  
(PhDT10, 5) 
 
(144) 
The researcher himself observed the pronunciation 
problems of the students of ELT 1.02 in relation to segmental 
phonemes, attending the final exam of the spoken course with 
the permission of the instructor. 
(PhDT10, 7) 
 
 
(145) 
A Turkish Cypriot, I, grew up in a family where my father 
was a true bilingual in Turkish and Greek and proficient in 
English. My mother, who was only an elementary school 
graduate can still remember the English she had learnt at 
primary school and can communicate with a lower level 
competence with English speaking people. …I felt the need to 
understand the language situation in Cyprus and how it 
evolved. Hence, I attempted to study the multilingual

situation in Northern Cyprus and its relation to English 
language in education with the following purpose. 
 
(Full text of this excerpt is available in Appendix C as 
Excerpt 14) 
 
 
(PhDT18, 7) 
 
In 2 of the 20 instances in which author presence was marked, the 
authors presented a limitation concerning their research methods (See 
excerpts 146, 147).  
 
(146) 
A greater number of participants would have let the 
researcher have a broader frame of the happenings, which 
might make the study findings more generalisable. 
(PhDT6, 7)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(147) 
Therefore, in order to understand multilingualism as such, a 
study of the case of Cyprus, in particular Northern Cyprus 
as the researcher herself can only access information in 
Northern Cyprus due its political status, seems inevitable. 
(PhDT18, 5) 
 
In 1 of the 20 instances marked with author presence, the authors 
organized their texts and guided the reader through the argument (See 
Excerpt 148) In another one, the author presented the research and the 
research question by using an author presence marker (See excerpt 149).

Hence, the researcher in this study also aimed to find out 
whether the students taking a phonetics course supplemented 
by practice were better at producing problematic English 
consonants and vowels than those taking only a theory-
based phonetics course with no supplementary practice.

CHAPTER V  
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS 
 
The contrastive, corpus-based analyses of the PHDT and RA 
introductions in this study revealed extensive variations, as well as 
similarities, in the text-linguistic, discoursal and rhetorical features of the 
two corpora. The similarities were extensively discussed in the previous 
chapter.  In this chapter, however, mainly the differences will be discussed, 
since the implications of the findings are for the novice authors who would 
like to recontextualize their PhDTs according to genre-specific features of 
the RA.    
 
5.1 Vocabulary Profiles of the RA and the PhDT Introductions 
 
The analysis revealed that the language of the RA introductions was 
structurally more academic, lexically dense, and thus, more difficult to read 
compared to the PhDT introductions. 
The type token ratio, which was 0.08 for the PhDT introductions, was 
0.13 for the RA introductions. Similarly, the RA introductions contained 
7.54 tokens per type.  This was 13.03 for the PhDT introductions. Moreover, 
the RA introductions involved 1.96 types per family, which was found to be 
2.35 for the PhDT introductions. These figures indicated that the authors of 
the RA introductions utilized a larger set of lexicon than the authors of the 
PhDTs. This also implied that the authors of the PhDT introductions, 
preferred to repeat or cycle the words or made use of inflections and 
derivations more frequently than the authors of the RA introductions.   
The findings reported so far were also supported with the hand-tagged 
move structure analysis. The authors of the RA introductions used more 


## Page 134

 
119
verbs than the authors of the PhDT introductions in Step 1 of the third 
move, presenting the present work descriptively. In the RA corpus 50.63% 
of the verbs were used only once, while this ratio was 44.44% in the PhDT 
corpus.     
As far as the readability of the texts were concerned, the RA 
introductions contained more sentences per paragraph (4.9), compared to the 
number of sentences in the PHDT introductions (3.3).  Moreover, the 
average number of words per sentence was more (29.7) in the RA 
introductions, compared to the number of words per sentence in the PhDT 
introductions (20.4). In addition, the average number of characters per word, 
which was 5.3 for the PhDT introductions, was 5.5 for the RA introductions. 
Lastly, the number of passive structures was more in the RA introductions 
(29%) compared to the PHDT introductions (21%).  These figures indicate 
that the RA introductions contained longer paragraphs, longer sentences and 
longer words than the PhDT introductions. Thus, the Flesch Reading Ease 
was found to be less for the RA introductions (20%), compared to the PhDT 
introductions (32.3).  
 
5.2 Differences Concerning the Move Structures of the RA and the  
      PhDT Introductions 
 
The CARS Model (Swales, 2005), to a large extent described the move-
step structure of the RA introductions in this study. However, this model 
could not account for the move-step structure of the PhDT introductions. 
First of all, the authors of the PHDT introductions did not tend to establish a 
niche in the previous research. Instead, they described their motive to 
conduct the study, which was in most cases a problem that they observed in 
their immediate context.  Moreover, they stated the assumptions, limitations, 
scope of their study and made lengthy definitional clarifications which were 
rarely found in RA introductions.   


## Page 135

 
120
 
The M1-M2-M3 pattern of the CARS model accounted for majority of 
the RA introductions. Twenty three out of 25 RA introductions adopted the 
M1-M2-M3 pattern. However, the predominant move pattern was M1-M3 
for the PhDT introductions. Fourteen PhDT introductions out of 25 adopted 
this pattern. In the RA introductions, after establishing the territory (M1), 
the authors tended to establish the niche (M2) by indicating a gap in 
previous studies. Finally, they presented their work by announcing their 
work descriptively.  
The authors of the RA introductions established the niche in previous 
research in several different ways. Most frequently, the niche was 
established by using a negative or quasi-negative quantifier.  Lexical 
bundles like “very few studies were conducted”, “not much is known”, “few 
studies have evaluated” or “few if any attempts have been made” were the 
most common ways of establishing the niche in the previous studies. These 
were followed by expressions of lexical negation like “the research has 
failed”, “studies are rare and unsatisfactory” and “limitations or lack of 
previous studies”.  
As opposed to the authors of the RA introductions, the authors of the 
PhDT introductions tended not to establish a niche or indicate a gap in the 
previous research.  Instead, with increasing specificity, the authors (21 out 
of 25) focused on a specific, local problem that motivated them to conduct 
the study rather than an observed niche in the previous research. This 
problem could be a shortcoming or problem concerning the language 
education in the national level such as “teachers throughout Turkey 
complaining about their students’ lack of communicative skills”. It could 
also be a problem whose scope was limited to the institution that the author 
is affiliated to. “The need to maintain a standard across the institution with 
regard to teacher training activities” is an example to such problems. The 
third type of problem was a personal drive or interest that motivates the 


## Page 136

 
121
author to conduct the study, such as “feeling the need to understand how the 
language education in the close environment of the author evolved in time”.  
Unlike the authors of the RAs, the authors of the PhDT introductions did 
not tend to critically review the previous studies. This might have two 
possible explanations. The first one is related to the aim and audience of the 
PhDT thesis, which are quite different from the RA. The authors of the 
PhDTs are not in the position of promoting their studies in a competitive 
arena. The second reason might be the authors’ reservations in making high-
level claims about their own research as novice researchers. These findings 
were parallel to the findings reported by Bunton (1998), which indicated 
that the second move, “establishing a nice” was likely to take the form of 
elaborating on a particular research problem, as opposed to indicating a gap 
in the PhD theses written by social sciences students.  
  
5.3 Differences Concerning Steps within the Moves of the RA and the   
       PhDT Introductions  
 
The authors of the PhDT introductions utilized all step options for Move 
3, except for Step 5 (announcing principle outcomes) which was used by 
only one of authors.   Nevertheless, there were three more steps, “stating the 
limitations of the study” (18 in 25 introductions) “stating the scope of the 
study” (18 in 25 introductions), and “stating the assumptions” (15 in 25 
introductions), which were commonly utilized by the authors of the PhDT 
introductions and which did not exist in the RA introductions. 
The limitations and the scope of the study were concerned with the 
parameters that decreased the generalizability power of the findings. The 
scope specifically described the aim of the study, while the limitations were 
related to the research methods, such as the number of subjects. The 
assumptions, on the other hand, concerned the authors’ proactive 
clarifications about the aspects of the research that might be prone to 
criticisms. Some of these assumptions like “the data collection tools are 


## Page 137

 
122
valid and reliable” were related to the research design. Few others like 
“Language teachers should be aware of the learners' styles and strategies, 
capacities to learn in order to achieve a successful result in the teaching and 
learning process” were more concerned with the theory that the study was 
built upon.  
 
5.4 Differences Concerning the Citations in the RA and PhDT  
      Introductions 
 
There were substantial variations in the citation frequencies, citation 
types, choice of verb tenses, and reporting verbs across the two corpora. 
First of all, the authors of the RA introductions tended to cite more 
frequently (in every 1.3 sentences) compared to the authors of the PhDT 
introductions, who made reference to a source in every 7 sentences. 
Secondly, unlike the authors of the RA introductions who preferred non-
integral (62.3% of all citations) citations, the authors of the PhDT 
introductions preferred integral (62.2% of all citations) citations. Reporting 
citations was a less common option for both groups of authors. However, it 
was a much less frequent (23.9% of all citations) option for the authors of  
PhDT introductions in comparison with the authors of the RA introductions 
(44.4% of all citations).  Thirdly, the authors of the PhDT introductions had 
more tendency (14.2% of all citations) to exercise secondary citation, 
compared to the authors of the RA introductions who made use of secondary 
citation in less than 3 percent of their citations. Lastly, unlike the RA 
introductions, the PhDT introductions contained more explicit quotations.  
In the corpus of the RA introductions, only 5% of all citations were explicit 
quotations. This was 14.5% in the corpus of the PhDT introductions.  
The tendency to use integral citations and explicit quotations suggests 
that the authors of the PHDT introductions had a strong tendency in 
highlighting the source of their claims. Pecorari (2006,10), who also found 
that the post-graduate students in her study tended to use secondary citations 


## Page 138

 
123
and explicit quotations comments that when subjective claims are at stake 
great care may be needed to give a “nuanced rendering”, making claims 
neither stronger nor weaker than the original author intended. Explicit 
quotation can be one strategy for this.   
As for the frequency of secondary citation, Pecorari (2006) points out 
that this type of citation might be misleading since the reader might have 
difficulty in identifying whether the language cited belongs to the primary 
or the secondary source. Therefore, Pecorari (ibid.) states that secondary 
citation is generally less desirable than reference to the primary source and 
should be signaled clearly when used. 
 
5.5 Differences Concerning the Verb Tenses in the RA and the PhDT 
      Introductions 
 
The main difference in the use of the verb tenses in the two corpora 
concerned the weight of each tense within each corpus. The distribution of 
the tenses was more even for the RA introductions (Simple Present, 60%;  
Simple Past 19%; Present Perfect, 5%; Future Tense 1%), compared to the 
PhDT introductions (Simple Present, 86%;  Simple Past 8%; Present 
Perfect, 4%; Future Tense 2%). The authors of PhDT had the tendency to 
use Simple Present Tense in almost all parts of their introductions including 
the second step of the third move, presenting RQs and hypotheses (100% of 
all Step 2 statements). However, unlike the authors of the PhDT 
introductions, the authors of the RA introductions stated their research 
questions and hypotheses in the Simple Past Tense in 15 out of 25 Step 2 
statements.  
 
 
 
 
5.6 Differences Concerning the Author Presence Markers in the RA  


## Page 139

 
124
      and the PhDT introductions 
 
In contrast to the authors of the RA introductions, who used self-
mentions frequently (in 18 out of 25 RA introductions), the authors of the 
PhDT introductions rarely (in 10 out of 25 introductions) marked their 
presence in their writing.  The RA introductions contained 31 self-mention 
instances, which was 20 for the PhDT introductions. Also, in most of these 
instances, the authors of the  PhDT introductions preferred to mention 
themselves as “the/this researcher” or  “this author” (16 out of 20 self-
mention instances) instead of the personal pronouns I (2 instances) and we 
(2 instances). In contrast, in all of the self-mentions in the RA introductions, 
the authors used the personal pronouns I and we.  
Another variation between the two corpora concerned the rhetorical 
function of the self-mentions. All of the self-mentions in the RA 
introductions either expressed the soundness and uniqueness of the research 
or personalized the claims of the author, which are regarded as self-
promotional strategies by Harwood (2005). However, none of the self-
mentions in the PhDT introductions fulfilled these functions. The authors 
marked their presence in their writing as a tool to guide the readers through 
their writing or to recount their experimental procedure and methodology. 
Martinez (2005) also found that the nonnative English-speaking novice 
authors in her study had less tendency to use the first person pronouns in 
non-risk functions such as stating a goal, rather that high-risk functions such 
as presenting their work and announcing principle outcomes.  
In parallel with the findings obtained in this study, the PhD students in 
Hyland’s (2005) study were also found to be more comfortable in using self-
mentions than the MA students in the same study. However, as a general 
tendency, many of the students who were interviewed saw self-mentions as 
inappropriate for novices, believing that it conflicted with the requirement 
of objectivity and academic writing.   


## Page 140

 
125
Hyland (2005)  points out that self-mention plays a crucial role in 
“mediating the relationship between writers’ arguments and the expectations 
of their readers, and the decision to adopt an impersonal rhetorical style or 
to represent oneself explicitly can influence the impression writers make on 
readers and have significant consequences  for how their message is 
received”. Especially, the writers in soft disciplines like humanities and 
social sciences, “the writers should seek to display a disciplinary situated 
stance towards the issues they discuss by weaving different kinds of support 
into a coherent and individual contribution to the field” (143).  
Swales (2004, 117) comments that unlike the research articles in more 
competitive arenas, the PhDT introductions may also lack certain 
explicitness with regard to the role and innovative character of the writer’s 
own research. However, according the Swales (ibid.), this last criticism may 
not necessarily reflect rhetorical weakness per se but rather an unassuming 
objectivity. “After all, not all doctoral students believe in their hearts that 
their theses are really making a substantial and original contribution to the 
field” (Swales, ibid.).   
 
5.7  Implications 
 
The findings of this study might have implications for novice writers 
who would like to publish their research in academic journals and more 
specifically, who would like to recontextualize their PhD theses as research 
articles.  In this respect, the findings might be utilized in the supervision of 
graduate students of ELT to help them more effectively respond to the 
expectations of their discourse community. Part of getting acceptance in this 
community is the “acculturation process of learning how to write in the way 
deemed appropriate by the mature practitioners of the craft.” (Wood, 2001) 
As pointed out by Rampton (1990) expertise (as opposed to an innate 
concept of nativespeakerhood) is learned, partial and relative.  


## Page 141

 
126
From a pedagogical perspective, focusing on the variations across the 
introductions in the RAs and PhDTs and on the gaps between the novice and 
expert authors’ language as revealed in this study would empower the 
novice authors to become members of their academic discourse community. 
Pecorari (2006) also points out that if the occluded aspects of writing such 
as overuse of explicit quotations and secondary citation go unaddressed, as a 
worrying consequence, the graduate students may leave the university with 
important skills unlearned. The novice authors’ awareness might be raised 
on the following areas, which might help them in recontextualizing their 
PhDTs as RAs.   
1. Lexico-Grammatical Aspects 
- 
A larger set of lexicon is utilized in RAs 
compared to the PhDTs. 
- 
There is relatively less use of repetition and 
cycling of words and less use of inflections and 
derivations in RAs compared to PhDTs. 
- 
The RAs contain longer paragraphs, longer 
sentences and longer words compared to the 
PhDTs.  
- 
There are more passive structures in the RAs 
compared to the PhDTs.  
2. Discoursal Aspects 
- 
The RAs generally follow the CARS Model of 
Swales (M1-M2-M3) (2005). 
- 
The Second Move, establishing a niche, is not an 
“optional” but an “obligatory” step for the RAs. 
Most frequently, the niche is established by using 
a negative or quasi-negative quantifier. 
- 
The steps of “stating assumptions” “stating 
limitations”, “describing the scope of the study”  


## Page 142

 
127
and “making definitional clarifications” are rarely 
found in RAs.  
- 
 More citations (in every 1.3 sentences) are found 
in RAs compared to the PhDTs (in every 7 
sentences). 
- 
Generally, 
non-integral 
and 
non-reporting 
citations are preferred in RAs.   
- 
Secondary citations and explicit quotations are 
rarely found in RAs.  
- 
The distribution of the tenses is more even for the 
RA introductions (Simple Present, 60%;  Simple 
Past 19%; Present Perfect, 5%; Future Tense 1%), 
compared to the PhDT introductions. Moreover, 
in the RAs, the RQs and hypotheses are stated in 
the Simple Past Tense.  
3. Rhetorical Aspects 
- 
Self mentions are frequently used in RAs.  
- 
The personal pronouns I and we are the most 
frequent self-mention markers in the RAs.  
- 
Generally, the authors of the RAs use self-
mentions as a promotional strategy to express the 
soundness and uniqueness of the research or to 
personalize their claims.  
Three main directions might be followed to raise the students’ awareness 
of the lexico-grammatical, discoursal and rhetorical features of the research 
article. The first is the apprenticeship approach (Pecorari, 2006), which is in 
fact the co-authoring of a research article by the post-graduate student and 
the supervisor of the thesis.  Pecorari (2006) proposes that learning about 
the conventions of academic texts can be facilitated by an apprenticeship 


## Page 143

 
128
approach, which might be realized by the co-authoring of a research article 
by the post-graduate student and the supervisor of the thesis.  
The second approach entails more explicit integration of the input or 
awareness raising tasks into the PhD program or the supervision of the 
students by their thesis supervisor in the course of their research article 
writing process (Swales, 1987; Pickard, 1995; Swales and Feak, 2004; Li, 
2006; Peacock, 2006, Charles, in press).    
One way of raising students’ awareness of the genre specific features of 
the research article might be a genre-based project work, originally 
proposed by Swales (1987) about the use of citations. In this project, the 
students conduct research into the quantitative and qualitative aspects of 
citation. Thus for former: each student takes a journal and analyzes an 
agreed number of recent articles in terms of the language of citations. The 
class’ pooled expertise is used to identify individually unrecognized 
language. A master table of all findings is prepared and the emerging paper 
is redrafted. This project proposed for citations may also be applied for 
other aspects of the research articles such as the use of self-mention 
markers, verb tenses and the language used within different moves of the 
research article.  
A second awareness raising strategy would be to have the graduate 
students conduct a small-scope version of the present study as a program 
requirement. The students might utilize the vocabulary profiling software or 
carry out a hand-tagged move-structure analyses to identify the lexico 
grammatical, discoursal and rhetorical features of their own writing and 
compare the findings with expert writers’ language in research articles. 
Exploring the genre-specific variations across the two genres would 
empower the students to write more effective introductions.  
Swales and Feak (2004) provide input about salient lexico-grammatical 
features and a number of  awareness raising tasks geared towards the 


## Page 144

 
129
effective implementation of the CARS Model (Swales, 2004) by the 
graduate students.  
The last direction is concerned with the shift of PhD programs’ 
expectations as regards the discourse pattern of PhD thesis. Instead of the 
traditional thesis with the classic IMRAD pattern, the students might be 
required to write a thesis in the form of a compilation of research articles 
(Dong, 1998; Paltridge, 2002). The chapters of the article compilation thesis 
is more concise than typical thesis chapters with less of the “display of 
knowledge” that is often found in a thesis. Further in terms of audience, they 
are written more as “experts writing for experts”, than “novices writing for 
admission to the academy” (Dong, 1998). 
This study was a contrastive analysis of the genre-specific features of 
the PhD thesis and the research article in ELT. Specifically, it focused on 
the genre-specific features of introductions in a corpus of PhD theses written 
by PhD students enrolled in PhD programs offered by Turkish universities 
and in a corpus of the research articles published by authors of different 
nationalities in academic journals.  
With respect to the research questions set at the beginning of the study, 
the findings of this study were limited to the 25 RAs selected from 5 ELT 
journals and 25 PhDTs written in 6 ELT programs. Thus, the implications 
were for the Turkish students and novice researchers enrolled in PhD 
programs in Turkey. These implications might be more generalisable with 
further research on contrastive genre-specific discourse analysis of PhD 
theses written by PhD students of different nationalities enrolled in PhD 
programs in different parts of the world and research articles written by 
expert authors of different nationalities.  Moreover, contrastive analysis of 
the genre-specific features of the RAs and PhDTs according to the journal 
and the PhD program that they are affiliated to would reveal whether these 
features are further shaped according to the expectations of smaller 
discourse communities within the field of ELT.

CHAPTER VI  
CONCLUSION 
 
Recontextualization of PhD theses as research articles is a very common 
practice in the research world. After completing a PhD thesis, the novice 
scholar feels prepared to take a step into the discourse community (Swales, 
1981, 1990) of the expert scholars by having a research article published in 
an academic journal.  Swales (2004) emphasizes the shift in the definition of 
genre from a static entity towards a dynamic entity by introducing the 
concept of “genre networks”. In this framework, recently, doctoral theses 
which are based on a compilation of publishable articles are gaining 
popularity, since writing a research article is widely considered as the next 
stage of writing a PhD thesis.   
However, writing a research article is not an easy task for novice 
researchers, who begin their study as outsiders in the academic community. 
This process might be particularly difficult for non English-speaking 
scholars, since they must deal with both “apprenticeship as novices in their 
fields of academic research” and the challenge of a new genre” (Gosden, 
1995, Canagarajah, 1996, Flowerdew, 2000, Misak et al., 2000 ).  
The focus of this study was specifically the introduction parts of the PhD 
theses and the research articles, because the introductions are known to be 
problematic for most academic writers since getting started on a piece of 
academic writing is often regarded as more difficult than writing the 
continuation.  The introduction part constitutes “a vital part of packaging, 
designed to alert potential users, to persuade them that this is a valuable 
product, one that they cannot do without”. (Harwood, 2005: 1210)

This study employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches, 
comprising frequency counts and text analyses of 25 introductions in a 
corpus of theses written in PhD programs in ELT offered by Turkish 
universities and in a corpus of 25 ELT research articles published by authors 
of different nationalities in major academic journals.   
The contrastive analysis of the lexico-grammatical, discoursal and 
rhetorical features of the PhDT and RA introductions in this study pointed to 
the existence of variation across two genres, which needs to be addressed in 
recontextualizing PhD theses as research articles.  
The vocabulary profiling and readability analyses revealed that the 
language of the RA introductions was relatively more academic, lexically 
dense, and thus, more difficult to read compared to the PhDT introductions. 
Moreover, both the computer-supported and hand-tagged analyses revealed 
that the authors of RA introductions used more variety in their lexical 
choices in exercising the steps and moves in all parts of their writing.  
Although the CARS Model (Swales, 2005) accounted for the move-step 
structure of the RA introductions, it was not completely compatible with the 
PhDT introductions. First of all, the authors of the PHDT introductions did 
not tend to establish a niche in the previous research. Instead, they described 
a problem that they observed in their immediate context.  Moreover, they 
stated the assumptions, limitations, scope of their study and made lengthy 
definitional clarifications which were rarely found in RA introductions. The 
distribution of the tenses across the moves was more even for the RA 
introductions compared to the PhDT introductions. 
There were also substantial variations in the citation frequencies, 
citations types, choice of tense, and reporting verbs between the two 
corpora.  
First of all, the authors of the RA introductions tended to cite more 
frequently  compared to the authors of the PhDT introductions. Secondly, 
unlike the authors of the RA introductions who preferred non-integral

132
citations, the authors of the PhDT introductions preferred integral citations. 
Thirdly, the authors of the PhDT introductions had more tendency to 
exercise secondary citation, compared to the authors of the authors of the 
RA introductions who rarely made use of secondary citation. Lastly, unlike 
the RA introductions, the PhDT introductions contained more quotations 
that were explicit.   
The rhetorical features, namely, the self-mention frequencies and 
strategies also showed variance across the two corpora.  The authors of the 
PhDT introductions did not tend to individualize their contribution to the 
field. In contrast to the authors of the RA introductions, who frequently used 
self-mentions, the authors of the PhDT introductions rarely marked their 
presence in their writing.  The self-mentions in the RA introductions either 
expressed the soundness and uniqueness of the research or personalized the 
claims of the author, which are regarded as self-promotional strategies by 
Harwood (2005). However, the authors of the PhDT introductions preferred 
to mark their presence in their writing solely to fulfill non-risk functions 
such as guiding the readers through their writing or to recount their 
experimental procedure and methodology.  
The findings of this study might have implications for novice writers 
who would like to publish their research in academic journals and more 
specifically, who would like to recontextualize their PhD theses as research 
articles.  In this respect, the findings might be utilized in the supervision of 
graduate students of ELT to help them more effectively respond to the 
expectations of their discourse community.  
Three main directions were proposed to raise the students’ awareness of 
the lexico-grammatical, discoursal and rhetorical features of the research 
article. The first was the apprenticeship approach (Pecorari, 2006) involving 
the co-authoring of a research article by the post-graduate student and the 
thesis supervisor. The second approach was the integration of the input or 
awareness raising tasks into the PhD program or the supervision of the 


## Page 148

 
133
students by their thesis supervisor in the course of their research article 
writing process. The last proposal was a shift from the “traditional thesis” 
into the “article-compilation thesis” (Paltridge, 2000; Dong, 1998) in the 
target PhD programs.

Full-Text Versions of the Truncated Excerpts  
(1) 
For years and years, foreign language has been intensively 
taught in Turkey both as a second language and as a medium 
of instruction. Nevertheless, teachers throughout the country 
have been complaining about their students' lack of 
communicative skills in English and their unwillingness to 
participate in any sort of discussion in the class. Why, then, 
one might ask, cannot the particular demands of learners of 
English still be satisfied whereas they are actively involved in 
language learning at almost all level of their training? Is

shortcomings of following communicative approaches to 
language teaching and learning? Does it really work in 
practice?

producing fluent and accurate speakers of English, yet 
unintelligible speakers of English. This is, in fact, owing to 
the English teachers' lack of knowledge in phonetics and 
phonology.

as the profession requires. For this reason, they cannot

teach their students how problem sounds, such as / 0 / in 
thin, I n I in this and / n/ in going are produced.

It is a fact that English is one of the most important foreign 
languages taught at all levels of the educational system in 
Turkey. A great deal of effort and money has been spent in 
order to teach it effectively to Turkish students by both 
parents and the government. Needless to say, learners, 
themselves, are also aware of the fact that learning a foreign 
language, especially English, in Turkey is important in 
education, trade and international relations. Although the 
learners, the parents and the government are conscious of 
this phenomenon, the intended goals cannot be obtained 
adequately. One of the causes of this failure at the 
elementary education can be the course books followed and 
teaching activities they involve. 
(PhDT2, 2) 
(4) 
 
 
In our present education system, most teachers do not seem to 
be equipped with the necessary skills to educate and prepare 
future generations for the twenty-first century, the era of 
knowledge. In order to help our students to compete with the 
citizens of other developed countries in the field of knowledge 
and advanced technology, they must be properly educated to 
fully utilize higher order thinking skills and hence become 
critical thinkers. Unfortunately, in our education system in 
Turkey, memorization and rote learning is overemphasized 
leading the students to simply to answer test items aimed at 
preparing them for important tests, such as university entrance 
exam. Although we know that critical thinking is more 
important than rote memorization, not many teachers tend to 
teach critical thinking skills in their classes. As a result, our 
students lack learning the skills of questioning, researching, 
analyzing, interpreting and the like since we do not teach them 
how to process information. Instead, we teach them factual 
information, which many students find irrelevant and 
meaningless (Good & Brophy, 1994). Therefore, they do not 
become critical thinkers.

This is also true of the majority of the Turkish EFL students who 
ostensibly have difficulty in using language for practical 
purposes when they have a message to get across. The very 
assumption made with reference to this case of Turkish 
learners of English stresses the importance of the issues 
involved in the application of communicative language 
teaching. 
In parallel to this discussion, a common awareness that 
Turkish learners of English can know the grammar and yet 
be unable to activate that knowledge to communicate 
efficiently leads us to consider the underlying factors in 
connection with the development of communicative language 
teaching. 
As a matter of fact, the problem posed by the complex nature 
of communication and the factors embedded in the individual 
characteristics of Turkish learners of English does not 
indicate the scant attention devoted to English instruction in 
Turkey. On the contrary, for the past several decades, 
Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) has been 
one of the most important goals of national education in 
Turkey. English has been a required course from elementary 
school through the first year in high school. Before entering 
universities, students usually have to study English for at least 
six years. Therefore, effective English teaching and learning 
have been a major concern among students at all levels of 
education in Turkey. 
Although the aforementioned needs are so pressing and 
English is considered so important a subject in language 
education of Turkey, traditional EFL teaching methods and 
curriculum designers have been seriously disconnected from 
the rapid development of ideas underlying communicative 
language teaching. 
Consequently, students' needs for more pragmatic and 
effective 
communicative 
language 
skills 
and 
factual 
knowledge written in English have become increasingly 
insatiable. There still exists a large gap between theory and 
practice in Turkey's English instruction and thus, a high level 


## Page 182

 
167
of English proficiency today remains a great barrier to 
elementary, high school and even to university EFL teaching 
and learning.  
In order to illustrate this assumption held, Turkish students, 
for example, are found unable to use grammatical 
knowledge properly in spontaneous conversation. Research 
suggests that Turkish learners of English including the 
majority of teacher trainees in the English Departments of 
Turkish universities have been criticised for being able to 
demonstrate 
grammatical 
knowledge 
on 
a 
grammar 
examination very well, but most of them lack the ability to 
speak and understand language accurately and fluently. 
Since most Turkish students' oral performance after six years 
of studying English  is unsatisfactory, the effectiveness of 
their learning to speak English by memorising grammatical 
rules is seriously in doubt. 
On the other hand, English instruction operating at almost 
all levels of proficiency in Turkey generally still follows the 
Traditional Grammar Translation Method, which mainly 
focuses on students' reading skill development while their 
listening and speaking skills are nearly unstressed. 
In reference to a survey, worthy of attention for our purposes, 
conducted by Songün (1993), almost 90% of English teachers 
working in the elementary and high schools in Izmir, one of the 
largest cities in Turkey, agreed that they mostly adopted the 
Grammar Translation Method as a means of teaching 
English. 
It appears that the various shortcomings in English instruction 
in Turkey do not match the very implementation of the 
fundamental 
innovations derived 
from communicative 
language teaching. Based on a communicative view of 
language, it is imperative that further reasons for these defects 
be fully investigated in search for an appropriate syllabus 
design corresponding to learners' communicative needs. 
 
(PHDT20, 4-5) 
 
 
(6) 
English language teacher education in Turkey has been 
rapidly increasing in importance especially during the past 
decade because English has now become part of the 


## Page 183

 
168
elementary school curriculum. There is a need for a large 
number of English language teachers in secondary schools 
as well as at tertiary level. During the past few years, a 
number of private English-medium universities have sprung 
into life in Turkey. The many faculties of education in Turkey 
are addressing this need and training English language 
teachers, yet there is no specific training for the trainers; that 
is to say, trainer training is a field all on its own but, 
unfortunately, there is no faculty or school that directly 
addresses this particular issue. Consequently, when a 
language institution needs to train new teachers or retrain 
experienced teachers, there are very few qualified trainers to 
perform this job. What happens in most instances is that 
experienced English teachers are approached by the 
administration and are invited to show the new teachers how 
the language courses are run in that particular institution; 
i.e., these experienced teachers start their careers as a trainer 
through orientation programs for new staff. In some cases, this 
job may be executed partly or wholly by a member of the 
administration. This 'trainer' also often ends up running short 
courses or doing sessions in pre-service and in-service teacher 
training courses thus beginning to take the first step beyond 
orientation and towards teacher education (TEdn). This system 
seems to work up to a point; however, there are cases when 
there are no possible 'trainer' candidates or when the selected 
'trainer' seems or feels inadequate. In DBE at METU, the 
situation is similar to that described above in that the current 
TEds have all been asked to take on this new role while they 
were practicing English language instructors in the 
department. 
 
 
 
(PhDT11, 12)

Regarding the less proficiency gains, students attending 
Eskişehir Anadolu University, Turkey can be a good example. 
These 
students 
are 
required 
to 
complete 
one-year 
preparatory program before starting their own school and 
are assigned to different language levels based on the score 
they get from the Michigan Placement Test. In this intensive 
preparatory program, students take six lessons: core course, 
grammar,   writing,   reading,   speaking,   and   listening.   A  
pedagogical   grammar, represented in foreign language 
textbooks (Tonkyn, 1994; cited in Tschirner, 1996), is taught 
in a traditional fashion. In other words, rules are provided 
explicitly and then students are required to produce the 
structures taught.    The activities are composed of 


## Page 184

 
169
mechanical ones such as fill-in-the blanks, multiple choice, 
circle the correct answer, which require students to  work 
individually most of the time. Observations show that even 
intermediate level students make errors in most grammatical 
structures. Like in Montrul's study, a pilot test administered by 
the researcher at the end of the 2000-2001 Spring Term 
showed that English causative constructions were problematic 
for Turkish learners of English at intermediate level even though 
they received plenty of exposure to English (see section 3.2. 
The Pilot Test). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(PhDT8, 2)

For the past semesters, university supervisors have reported 
that the reflective papers that the student teachers wrote 
have been similar to narrative descriptions of events without 
any attempt to reflect critically about those events.  
Moreover, in discussion sessions, the university supervisors 
also complained about student teachers' lack of reflective 
ability in student teachers' discussion of their practice 
teaching experiences.  Since student teachers were 
experiencing 
difficulty 
in 
reflection, 
perhaps 
more 
opportunities for enhancing reflective thinking should be 
provided in the teacher education program by implementing 
portfolios systematically within undergraduate curriculum. 
 
(PHDT21, 20) 
(11) 
What's more, each university comes up with its own syllabi 
led by self-determined course objectives, so a variety of 
materials are being used for a variety of reasons, which 
means 'there is not a standard course book, either. On the 
whole, standardization is left out of question, whereas 
standardization among ELT departments would mean 
offering equal opportunities to students at schools. 
As a result, the starting point for this dissertation is the need 
for a suggested syllabus with clear objectives, means and 
ends, together with course materials to be organized into a 
course book for the course. 
 
(PHDT22, 2) 
(12)

Bilkent University School of English Language, as 
mentioned previously, is an institution that offers training 
and development opportunities for all the teachers in the 
institution. Therefore, there are a number of courses run 
every year depending on the needs of the school and the 
teachers. Hence, since there are a number of courses run 
every year, there is a need to maintain a standard across 
the institution with regard to effective training sessions 
and the qualities of good trainers. Moreover, since 
meeting the needs of the participants on training courses is 
of utmost importance, it would be interesting to note the 
similarities and differences of the perceptions of the 
teacher trainers and teachers with different experience 
levels regarding the features of training sessions and 
effective teacher trainers. The results could help teacher 
trainers better understand the expectations of the teachers 
and therefore meet their needs accordingly. 
 
(PHDT23, 10) 
(13) 
After teaching English at different levels for eight years, the 
researcher has noticed that even the students with high 
proficiency levels have some fears that affect their 
performances in language classes. Informal interviews of the 
researcher with students have shown that most of the students 
are affected from an apprehension about language. They find 
themselves unsuccessful in these language courses because 
they fear to make a grammatical mistake, forget a word or 
simply mispronounce a word and thus they avoid 
participating in the lesson. Some of the students might even 
show visible signs of nervousness and some physical 
reactions such as sweating and stuttering. The informal 
interviews with the instructors have also indicated that the 
number of the students who show this kind of reactions is 
quite high. The interviews and observations mentioned above 
have 
persuaded 
the 
researcher 
to 
investigate 
the 
apprehension mentioned by the students and the instructors.

A Turkish Cypriot, I, grew up in a family where my father 
was a true bilingual in Turkish and Greek and proficient in 
English. My mother, who was only an elementary school 
graduate can still remember the English she had learnt at 
primary school and can communicate with a lower level 
competence with English speaking people. She could also 
speak a little Greek which she learnt from the Greek women 
who came to work in her village. I studied in an English 
medium school, Turk Maarif Koleji (TMK), and although I 


## Page 186

 
171
have never lived with the Greeks, I have heard Greek spoken 
on television since my childhood. Moreover, everybody 
around me both educated and uneducated can speak some 
English, and some of them even some Greek. Therefore, I felt 
the need to understand the language situation in Cyprus and 
how it evolved. 
 
 
(PHDT18, 7) 
(15) 
In the course of this study the following assumptions will be 
undertaken: 
 
The course needs to be redefined so as to help achieve a 
standard among ELT departments. 
 
Literary texts are valuable authentic sources for both 
teachers and teacher trainees. 
 
Short stories are potentially suitable texts to be used for both 
training and teaching purposes in EFL, ESL, and English as 
the mother tongue contexts. 
 
Short story analysis not only helps teacher trainees or 
students learn and appreciate the genre better, but also 
improves their higher order thinking skills and provide them 
with the necessary input which help them interpret the 
discourse itself. 
 
Testing and evaluation should not merely be based on 
traditional written tests. On the contrary, alternative ways of 
testing should be implemented into the course. 
(PhDT22, 5)  
 
 
 
(17) 
There are two assumptions in this study. These are displayed 
as follows: 
3. It is more likely than not that the learners have a different 
perception of language and learning from the teachers. As 


## Page 187

 
172
revealed in several studies by Alcorso & Kalantzis (1985). 
Eltis & Low (1985). and Willing (1985), there are clear 
mismatches between learners* and teachers" views of 
language learning. The chances are that teachers could have 
grammar-oriented learners preferring structural or lexical 
practice to communicative tasks in communicatively 
designed courses. 
4. Communicative tasks are an area where a potential 
mismatch 
between 
teacher 
intention 
and 
learner 
interpretation occurs, as revealed by Kumaravadivelu (1991  
) and Breen(1987). 
(PhDT7, 13) 
 
 (21) 
 
In the course of the study, the following assumptions will be 
undertaken: 
1) In foreign language teaching, the teaching activities are 
a very important part of the teaching process, and should 
cover the needs of the learners. 
2) The existing activities designed for the sixth grade 
learners need to be redesigned in the light of the current 
developments such as Multiple Intelligences Theory. The 
principles of this theory need to be taken into consideration 
in this process. 
3) The course materials and activities to be used in the 
classroom should be motivating and appealing to the 
capacities of the learners. It is true that if an activity is 
enjoyable, it will be memorable. 
5) Language teachers should be aware of the learners' 
styles and strategies, capacities to learn in order to achieve a 
successful result in the teaching and learning process. 
6) The activities in FLT should be varied. It is true that MI 
based activities will be more retainable for the learners as 
they prove to be more useful when they learn by doing, 


## Page 188

 
173
feeling, and involving in any activities. 
7) The questionnaire designed for the study to collect the 
data is valid and reliable. It is also assumed that the 
responses to this questionnaire reflect the real and sincere 
opinions of the participants.

The scope of this research covers 100 vocational freshman 
and/or sophomore students studying Engineering, Fine arts, 
Business 
Administration, 
Economics, 
Education 
and 
Humanities and Letters at Bilkent University where the 
medium of instruction is English. The students range in age 
between 18 to 23 years old. All the subjects received a one 
year intensive EFL Program (at Prepatory School) before 
starting their first year in their departments. The students 
also receive English 101 in Fall semester and English 102 in 
Spring. The following factors will not be taken into 
consideration throughout the study: 
1. Motivation 
2. Career Orientation 
3. Personality (other than introversion, extroversion and 
ambiversion) 
4. Teaching Methods 
5. Cultural Background 
6. Age 
7. The Variety and the Content of the Tasks 
This study will not concentrate on the students who are 
novice, elementary or intermediate level students who study 
at Bilkent Preparatory Program. This dissertation aims to 
target the students studying Foreign Language Learning at 
advanced level. The educational background, the student 
profile of the departments, individual psychological 
problems and the factors that contribute to such issues, 
interpersonal and intrapersonal relations of the learner (i.e. 
with himself/herself, peer, group, family), environmental 
factors, 
the 
physical 
classroom, 
socio-cultural 
and 
economical factors will not be the center of attention in this 
study. 
(PhDT12, 8-9)

The limitations of this study is that only the teachers and 
trainers at Bilkent University are given the questionnaires. 
However, the aim of this study is to shed light on the trainers 
at Bilkent University, the data will be interpreted at an 
institutional basis. Therefore, the scale of this research 
cannot be  extended  any  further  since  Bilkent  University  
is the  ‘only’ University in Turkey offering the 1CELT and 
the DELTA courses at an institutional basis. Therefore, the 
results may not be generalisable to other institutions. The 
reason why the chi-square has been used to compare the 
ICELT and DELTA teachers' perceptions regarding the 
features of training sessions and the qualities of effective 
teacher trainers is because the SPSS chi-square data 
analysis procedure can only be used to address questions 
about the relations between two groups only. Since the 
researcher had three groups of informants, only the data 
collected from the ICELT teachers and the DELTA teachers 
could be analysed through the chi-square. As the number of  
the ICELT teachers was 42 and the DELTA teachers 14 chi-
square analysis could easily be done. The remaining data 
collected from the teacher trainers consisting of 6 
informants could only be analysed via the SPSS frequency 
distribution analysis program. 
(PhDT23, 11) 
(26) 
To begin with, as the aim is to suggest a syllabus, it is inevitable to 
search for the real inspiration, beliefs, and viewpoints which 
caused YÖK to introduce a short story course at ELT departments. 
However, YOK cannot offer much help because the World Bank 
did not leave any documents behind after the project completed. 
Therefore, academics involved in the project are now unknown, 
which will lead the study to question teacher trainers' ideas and 
approaches of the course at different universities. 
Secondly, appearing first in the 19th century, modern short story is 
one of the newest genres, but it can still offer a vast amount of 
examples. Therefore, it needs great care and attention to choose 
samples exemplifying both the genre itself and analysis / teaching 
methodology. Similarly, the literature offers a great deal on short 
story analysis but not much on teaching. Therefore, the analysis 


## Page 190

 
175
component of the study will be handled carefully so as to avoid 
confusion and overloading, and the teaching component will be 
built on the former review of the literature and the data gathered 
from questionnaires given at  the beginning.

The findings of this study are limited to the group of students 
who study English at Bilkent University First Year English 
Program in five different faculties which are; Economics, 
Engineering, Business Administration, Art -Design - 
architecture and Humanities and Letters. These students 
completed their 101 -English and Composition I- course and 
stated their 101 letter grade as they answer the 
questionnaires. Though the findings would not be applicable 
and could not be generalized to the entire university 
population, subjects from five different faculties provide the 
readers a further understanding and spectrum of what the 
general picture about this subject can be at the university 
level. Moreover, because of certain limitations and privacy 
issues, which personality type is successful in which 
language skill (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) 
could not be tested. 
(PhDT12, 10) 
(28) 
There are several limitations in the study. The first one is 
concerned with the number of subjects invoked in the study. 
Only the participants from the DBK took part in the study. 
The total number of students and teachers in the study was 
91 and 16 respectively. Administrative constraints rendered it 
hard to enlarge the size of the sample in the study by including 
participants from other departments of METU or from other 


## Page 191

 
176
universities. At the stage of data collection, utmost care was 
taken so as to ensure the reliability or the data. 
The third limitation in the study is concerned with the 
proficiency levels of the students in the study. Two groups of 
students with different levels of proficiency, elementary and 
intermediate levels, participated in the study. However, the 
proficiency level was not regarded as a variable in the study. 
The final limitation in the study is concerned with the number 
of the communicative tasks in the study. Due to the time 
constraint in the study only eight tasks were subjected to the 
quantitative and qualitative analysis. 
All the limitations mentioned above might have a restricting 
impact on the study. It is nevertheless, believed that the 
research will still yield valid and reliable findings as a result 
of certain variables being controlled, the use of two different 
groups of participants, as well as reliable data collection 
methods. 
 
 
(PhDT7, 13-14) 
 
(30) 
 
Apart from delimitation of time and resources, the study is 
limited to the third-year students at the ELT Department of  
Çukurova University. The main aim for choosing the third-
year students was the fact that they were to take translation 
courses for the first time according to the new curriculum 
prepared by HEC. The applicability of the results to other ELT 
departments may need further study to make a sound 
generalization. 
 
(PhDT16, 13) 
(31) 
 
An important limitation of this study is that only 
certain grammatical constructions such as phrases, clauses 
or embedded sentences are taken into consideration to be 
analyzed in writing, not all the grammatical constituents in 
English (see Appendix 16). 
The students' previous writing experiences are not 
taken into account. On the basis of the interviews the 
researcher carried out with the participating students, 
information about their previous education was obtained. 
According to this, it is observed that writing courses in both 
their NL and FL in the previous education had generally 
been ignored, and they had mostly been involved in 
mechanical exercises as part of the syllabus. The purpose of 


## Page 192

 
177
giving these exercises is that they could become successful in 
the University Entrance Examination rather than gaining 
other skills like writing and speaking in their previous 
education. 
(PhDT14, 15) 
 
(33) 
The scope of the study is given below: 
1- 
The sample size of this study is small (120 subjects), but 
larger than most studies conducted in PI research (see 
section 2.8.3.). 
2- 
Individual differences are not taken into account. 
3- 
Further research should be carried out to compare the 
effects of processing instruction in the learning of different 
linguistic features in English. 
4- 
The tasks on the pretest and the post/follow-up test have no 
communicative behavior; that is, students are not asked to 
speak or to do pair-work. 
5- 
The study is at sentence level. Further studies may involve 
causatives at discourse level. 
6- 
 Only one processing strategy {the first noun strategy) is 
investigated. 
7- 
Passive causatives are not examined. In a future study, 
they can be studied with causative verbs have, make, and 
get. 
8- 
Long-term 
effects 
of 
the 
two 
instructions 
under 
investigation should be reexamined since the long-lasting 
effects of instruction in this study are measured only over a 
period of five weeks. 


## Page 193

 
178
9- 
In this study, input is controlled, not spontaneous. In the 
future studies, spontaneous input can be used by adding oral 
tasks. 
 
 (PhDT8, 8) 
(34) 
This study was conducted through an intense contact with the 
two involved parties (15 student-teachers and 6 supervisor 
teachers). In order to provide an in depth description of what 
really is happening during the teaching practice period, 
mainly focusing on the effectiveness of supervisory feedback, 
every contact between the two groups of participants was 
attempted to be followed. These contacts included pre and 
post feedback sessions -immediate or delayed- and classroom 
observations with all participating student- teachers in all 
three types of schools (an Anatolian High School, a State 
High school and a Private High school) involved. The effects 
of mentors on the student-teachers were also considered in 
the study. The student- teachers were asked whether or not 
and how their mentors had influenced them. However, this 
aspect was not explored in an in-depth manner. The contacts 
between all the participating supervisor and the student- 
teachers were followed, all the participant student- teachers 
were visited in their practice schools, and their classes were 
observed with their supervisors, all the feedback sessions of 
all the supervisors were followed and recorded. The student- 
teachers and the supervisors were interviewed. Appointments 
with the participants for the first and the second rep-grid 
applications were arranged.   For each contact, contact 
summary sheets were filled (see Appendix C). All these 
procedures were rather occupying, and made it impossible to 
work with a larger population.  A greater number of 
participants would have let the researcher have a broader 
frame of the happenings, which might make the study 
findings more generalisable. However, in this study, the 
amount of data to be collected made it impossible.

So far, only very few studies have analysed learner 
collocations on the basis of a reasonable amount of natural 
production data (Chi et al.. 1994; Howarth 1996; Granger 
1998; Lorenz 1999).  
(RA1, 223) 
(36) 
There is increasing interest in semantic mapping as a 
teaching tool (Nation, 2001), but not much is known about 
the effectiveness of classroom language instruction that uses 
this technique.  
(RA3, 89) 
(37) 
However, this effect was found only for the lowest levels of 
learners (in 9th and 10th grades). 
(RA5, 72) 
(38) 
First of all, the study employed only three native-speaking 
raters.  
(RA7, 472) 
 
(39) 
This small  number of raters obviously increased the chance 
factor in the author's findings. 
 (RA7, 472) 
(40) 
 
Because previous studies on culturally influenced rhetorical 
patterns had reported differential preferences for or 
demands on discourse structures by raters of different 


## Page 195

 
180
language backgrounds (e.g., Kobayashi and Rinnert, 1996), 
there was sufficient ground to suspect that the findings 
reported in Chiang (1999) were valid at best only for French 
raters evaluating French writing samples produced by 
American subjects.  
 
(RA7, 472) 
(41) 
 
Amidst the enthusiasm over genre as a teaching tool, 
however, few studies have evaluated the effects of genre-
based pedagogy on students' language and literacy 
development.  
(RA8, 418) 
 
(42) 
In prefacing their evaluation of genre-based writing 
instruction in an ESP/EAP course, Henry and Roseberry 
(1998, p. 148) observe that "the arguments for and against 
the genre approach in ESP/EAP have been limited to the 
theoretical, and few if any attempts have been made to 
evaluate the approach empirically in an ESP/EAP context."  
 
(RA8, 418) 
 
(43) 
The discussion is presented against a background of well-
attested findings from cognitive psychology and speech 
science that have featured relatively little in accounts of 
second language acquisition (SLA).  
 
(RA18, 400) 
(44) 
Little research has been done to investigate what type of 
training will be most beneficial to bridge the gap between 
general English at secondary and undergraduate levels and 
disciplinary reading at post-graduate level, and to help 
students in EFL contexts gain this overall experience of 
reading research articles in their specialty area.

In a more recent overview, Ostler (2002) notes that there are 
no studies on the effectiveness of applications of CR in the 
classroom.

Surprisingly little work has been conducted on the next step 
in learning vocabulary in a formal classroom setting, namely 
the written practice activities that follow the presentation of 
any new vocabulary.  
 
(RA21, 274) 
(47) 
 
When analyzing the role of culture-specific background 
knowledge in L2 reading, schema-theoretic research has 
generally paid little attention to text-based and instrument-
based factors, giving rise to serious validity issues in 
measurement.  
 
(RA23, 496) 
(48) 
 
Thus, no opportunity has been offered to the readers to 
activate their abstract schemas in order to generate rich 
inferences.  
(RA23, 496) 
(49) 
 
Yet, determining text equivalency in this way leaves much to 
be desired from the perspective of validity in measurement.  
 
(RA23, 496) 
(50) 
 
The focus on salient points at the expense of enriching 
incidental information hinders an efficient encoding stage in 
that there is no active schema which guides the selection of 
relevant information, influences the interpretation, or 
integrates the new data with pre-existing knowledge.  
 
 (RA23, 496) 
(51) 
 
As such, no opportunity exists for proper inferencing to 
occur.

However, all the studies conducted on portfolios in teacher 
education dealt with portfolio use in science and math 
teacher education, but there are only two studies conducted 
on second language teacher education.  
  
(PhDT21, 19) 
(53) 
 
Moreover there is not even a single study conducted on 
foreign language teacher education.  
  
(PhDT21, 19)

No studies up to now in Turkey at University level have been 
conducted covering these issues up to now.

Despite the fact that there are lots of work on literary 
analysis or analysis of fiction, none of them fully fits in when 
possible aims of the course are considered.

In L2 learning, much of this research has failed to provide 
strong evidence; therefore, L2 professionals need more 
information about this potentially important process if they 
are to make good decisions about vocabulary teaching.

(RA15, 645) 
 
(59) 
Plotting the progress of attrition by means of a simple 
vocabulary test seems to be an example of researchers 
falling into the trap of treating vocabularies as mere lists of 
words which can be counted in simple ways. 
(RA16, 137) 
(60) 
Furthermore, when textual comprehension is tested by recall 
procedures, it is often the salient information in the text, 
linked to explicit memory, which is measured, while the less 
obvious data, which are more dependent on implicit memory 
are ignored.

However, although some suggestions on the teaching of 
collocations have been made in recent years (e.g. Lewis 
2000), it is largely unclear how and especially which of the 
great number of collocations in a language should be taught. 
 


## Page 199

 
184
 (RA1, 223) 
 
 
 
(61) 
 
Unfortunately, studies that analyse non-native speaker 
collocation production are not only rare, but also mostly 
unsatisfactory. 
 (RA1, 223) 
(62) 
 
Additionally, in some of these studies, the concept of 
collocation remains hazy, so that besides combinations such 
as heavy drinker combinations and lexical items such as 
striped shirt, alarm clock, or safety belt are, without further 
discussion, included among the items tested (e.g. Hussein 
1990; Farghal and Obiedat 1995). 
(RA23, 224) 
(63) 
 
Although Gamaroff (2000) states that language testing is not 
in an "abyss of ignorance" (Alderson, 1983 cited in 
Gamaroff, 2000), the choice of the 'right' essay writing 
evaluation criteria in many EFL/ESL programs remains 
problematic as often those chosen are inappropriate for the 
purpose.  
(RA4, 372) 
(64) 
 
At present, these memoirs provide the field with a wealth of 
observations about learning experiences of middle-class 
Caucasian, Asian, and Latina females but are rather scarce 
about the role of gender in language learning of 
heterosexual males, gay and lesbian learners, working-class 
individuals, or African immigrants.  
(RA9, 214) 
 
(65) 
 
For some time, now, I have felt that this way of looking at 
vocabulary attrition is an unsatisfactory one.

The primary purpose of this paper is not merely to suggest 
that the criteria for coding “corrective recasts” are 
problematic; it is certainly not to suggest that problems with 
such criteria can be rectified or mitigated. Rather, the 
primary purpose is to argue that the methodological practice 
of coding in the study of interaction, regardless of what 
criteria are actually presented, is problematic.

Another limitation to the study pertained to the specific lan-
guage investigated in it, and to the identity of the student 
population that was asked to produce the writing samples.  
 
(RA7, 472) 
(68) 
 
This lack of assessment has perhaps been one reason why 
genre-based teaching is sometimes controversial (Freedman, 
1993, 1994).  
(RA9, 214) 
 
(69) 
 
At the same time, recently there have been criticisms of some 
assumptions of CR research that may have negative 
pedagogical consequences, such as labeling students in 
terms of their national identities, the static view of cultures, 
ethnocentrism and essentialism (Kubota, 1999, 2001; Spack, 
1997; Zamel, 1997).

 The study of foreign language anxiety is still a relatively 
young area. As Scovel states in his literature review (1978), 
the early research in this field have mixed and confusing 
results. The confusion is probably due to the problematic 
definitions and the lack of a reliable and valid measure of 
anxiety specific to language learning (MacIntyre and 
Gardner, 1991a).

Since there are contradicting views for the effective 
outcomes of supervision, the issue seems to worth an in-
depth investigation.  
(PhDT6, 2) 
(72) 
 
Our original motivation in carrying out such an 
investigation derives from the lack of empirical research 
basing the various aspects communicative language 
teaching on the particular demands of learners and on the 
conditions of the Turkish educational system. 
 (PhDT19, 8) 
(73) 
 
 Studies showing the parallelism between FLA and SLA in 
terms of acquisition order is assumed to be unsatisfactory in 
that they focus on unrelated morphemes rather than the 
closely interwoven rules of UG, acquisition of which cannot 
be accomplished by general learning mechanisms.

As the subjects did not learn the material taught to 
them satisfactorily in the study by Sanchez (2002), it 
was thought that it would be wise to teach learners in a 
different way.  
(RA3, 89) 
(75) 
 
However, the measurements of language performance 
and the evaluations of task types and conditions in 
these studies do not generally consider interactive 
aspects of language use.  
(RA2, 324) 
(76)

However, as Shohamy (1990) pointed out, the identity 
of such a concept relative to the other components had 
not been adequately defined.  
(RA7, 472) 
 
 
(77) 
Partly because of this, discourse features had hardly 
received any emphasis or attention in the assessment of 
language samples produced by learners. 
 (RA7, 472) 
 
(78) 
One of the difficult issues in teaching academically bound 
ESL students to produce appropriate academic written text 
is that research has not established with certainty what 
specific syntactic and lexical features, when taken together, 
can create an impression of a seemingly simplistic or 
reasonably sophisticated text in written L2 discourse.  
(RA12, 275) 
(79) 
 
It seems to me, however, that the work reported in the 
previous paragraph does not really take the implications of 
the network idea seriously. 
 (RA16, 137) 
 
 
(80) 
 
However, as interest in vocabulary development grew, 
researchers began to realize that measuring size alone can 
no longer provide a satisfactory description of L2 learners' 
lexical knowledge because knowledge of words is mul-
tidimensional.  
(RA18, 548) 
(81) 
 
However, while the two-dimensional frameworks have 
received some empirical support, at this time, the three- and 
four-dimensional models are largely at the stage of being 
hypotheses and, as a whole, their effectiveness to account for 
vocabulary knowledge with an increase in proficiency has 
not been empirically tested.

Nonetheless, many persevere, convinced that their students 
need the interpersonal, analytical, problem-solving and 
decision-making skills that can be enhanced through case-
based learning. So, why are their students reluctant to 
participate? Why do they hold back from expressing their 
views in these situations? Can a better understanding of 
these factors help lecturers adopt more culture-sensitive 
practices in their case discussions? What steps might they 
take to more fully engage their Asian students? How might 
business communications specialists help the students to 
acquire the English language skills and confidence they need 
to take a more active role in these events?

In addition to questions about the value of different types of 
modifications, the potential interaction between modification 
type and learner proficiency remains an important issue. 
 (RA5, 72) 
 
(87) 
Despite the apparent importance of the fixed phrase in 
English for specific purposes, significant questions remain 
about the degree to which fixed phrases are unique to 
particular registers and the extent to which expert 
disciplinary writing differs from that of novices with respect 
to the use of discipline-specific frequent word combinations. 
 (RA17, 398) 
5. Expressed needs/desires/interests (6 instances)

To answer these questions satisfactorily, it is essential to 
identify the problems that learners have in dealing with 
collocations.  
(RA1, 223) 
 
(89) 
One of the issues in need of clarification in the field of 
communicative 
competence 
modeling 
concerned 
the 
construct of "discourse competence" (Canale, 1983).  
 
(RA7, 472) 
(90) 
 
However, some of the features in Chiang's (1999) research 
design indicated the need for further investigation.  
(RA7, 472) 
(91) 
 
In ESP and other fields, more studies are necessary to 
illuminate the influence, if any, genre-based teaching has on 
learners and the suitability of different approaches for 
specific populations of students.  
(RA8, 418) 
(92) 


## Page 205

Particularly needed in ESP are studies on long-term 
effects of such instruction, as practitioners who observe 
genre-based teaching to 'work' in their classrooms may be 
unaware of how, if at all, students put it to use months or 
years after a course or training session.  
(RA8, 418) 
(93) 
 
It follows that the role of cultural background knowledge in 
L2 inferential comprehension needs to be investigated not 
necessarily in the framework of two texts that are thought to 
be syntactically, lexically, and rhetorically equivalent, but in 
the context of the same text used in two different ways, one 
being the original and the other a culturally nativized 
version.  
(RA23, 496) 
 
PhDTs 
(94) 
 
 
The second factor that emerged from the literature was the 
need to further explore the processes of constructing 
portfolios by the student teachers from their perspectives, 
and identified the purpose of the portfolio from their own 
thinking.

While Ohta's study provides illuminating pictures of 
interactive tasks incorporated in beginning level courses, 
what happens at later stages of the language learning has 
not yet been explored with the same level of detail.  
(RA2, 324) 
(96) 
 
The modification employed in all of these studies, however, 
entailed primarily simplification of syntax and lexis, 
although it was sometimes mixed with elaborative 
modification. 
 (RA5, 71) 
(97)

While 'authentic' and 'natural' language is generally 
understood as that spoken or written by native speakers for 
real-life communication purposes, the definitions of what 
exactly count as authentic or natural have remained rather 
vague. 
 (RA2, 324) 
(98) 
Although researchers (Brown, 1987; Parker & Chaudron, 
1987; Tsang, 1987; Yano et al.., 1994) have expected that 
elaborated input would promote nonnative learners'  reading 
comprehension, the actual  research either involved students 
in an ESL environment (Brown, 1987; Tsang, 1987) or 
revealed no significant effect (Parker & Chaudron, 1987; 
Yano et al.., 1994).  
(RA5, 72) 
(99) 
 
This concept had increasingly been recognized by 
researchers in the field as one of the constituent abilities that 
contributed to a language learner's overall proficiency (e.g., 
Bachman and Palmer, 1982, Harley et al.., 1990, Henning 
and Cascallar, 1992, Schmidt, 1983), in addition to the more 
"traditional" element of grammatical knowledge and other 
situational abilities such as sociolinguistic competence and 
illocutionary competence (Bachman, 1990).  
(RA7, 472) 
 
(100) 
 
In writing assessment, the construct of "discourse 
competence" had often been conceptualized and labeled as 
"organization" (e.g., Kobayashi, 1992; Mullen, 1980; Sasaki 
and Hiroe, 1996) or "coherence" (e.g., Kobayashi and 
Rinnert, 1996) in a piece of writing. But as Chiang (1999) 
pointed out, these rating categories had not been 
analytically defined according to any theoretical models.  
 
(RA7, 472) 
(101) 
 
I will argue that approaching language memoirs as 
discursive constructions, rather than as factual statements, 
has great potential for the field of applied linguistics.

Studies showing the parallelism between FLA and SLA in

Although the relationship between proficiency in a foreign 
language and critical thinking skills has not been fully 
researched, the above mentioned theoretical and empirical 
studies imply that adult second language (English in our

Most of them rely on small-scale elicitation tests, often 
consisting of translation tasks, making it questionable 
whether the results are generalizable and whether they 
reflect the learners' actual production problems (e.g. 
Gabrys-Biskup 1990, 1992; Bahns and Eldaw 1993). 
 (RA1, 223) 
(107) 
 
Another problem has been the seemingly unquestioned use of 
recall procedures to measure reader-text interaction in L2 
reading, notwithstanding their several serious shortcomings 
concerning inferential comprehension.

BİR TÜR OLARAK ARAŞTIRMA SÖYLEMİNİN BÜTÜNCEYE 
DAYALI ÇÖZÜMLEMESİ: İNGİLİZ DİLİ EĞİTİMİ ALANINDAKİ 
DOKTORA TEZLERİ VE ARAŞTIRMA MAKALELERİ 
 
 
Kendi 
alanlarındaki 
söylem 
topluluğuna 
yeni 
adım 
atan 
araştırmacılar için araştırma makalesi yazmak oldukça zor bir deneyimdir, 
çünkü hem bu toplulukta yeni olmanın hem de farklı bir metin türünde 
yazmanın zorlukları ile başa çıkmak zorundadırlar. Doktora tezlerinin 
araştırma makalesi olarak yeniden bağlamlandırılması (recontextualization) 
sıklıkla karşılaşılan bir durumdur.  
Bu çalışmada Türkiye’deki üniversitelerin İngiliz Dili Eğitimi 
doktora programlarında yazılmış tezler ile aynı alandaki uluslararası 
yazarlar tarafından yazılmış ve yayınlanmış bilimsel makalelerin giriş 
bölümleri dilbilimsel olarak incelenmiştir. Bu iki bütünce arasındaki 
dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, 
metinsel 
ve 
sözbilimsel 
öğelerin 
karşıtsal 
çözümlemesi yapılmıştır. Hesaplamalı dilbilim ve elle işaretleme yöntemleri 
kullanılarak her iki bütüncenin okunurluk istatistikleri, sözcük özellikleri 
(vocabulary profiles), atıf ve eylem zamanlarının kullanımı, adım yapısı ve 
yazarın metin içerisindeki varlığı ile ilgili belirticiler karşıtsal olarak 
çözümlenmiştir.  
Çalışmanın sonuçları makalelerin giriş bölümlerinin, tezlerin giriş 
bölümlerine göre, dilbilgisel-sözcüksel olarak daha akademik ve daha yoğun 
olduğunu ve bu nedenle de okunurluk düzeylerinin daha düşük olduğunu 
göstermiştir. Ayrıca, CARS Model’in (Swales, 2005) makale girişlerinin 
adım yapısını büyük ölçüde yansıtmasına rağmen, tez girişlerinin adım 
yapısını yansıtmadığı görülmüştür. Bu farklılıklar bağlamında, İngiliz Dili

Eğitimi programlarında eğitim gören araştırmacıların daha etkili araştırma 
makaleleri yazabilmeleri için bazı öneriler getirilmiştir.  
Swales’in (2004) tür ağı (genre network) kavramına göre türler kendi 
aralarında metinsel ilişkiler oluştururlar. Buna göre, bilimsel sunumlar 
araştırma makalelerine, ya da araştırma makaleleri bilimsel sunumlara 
dönüşebilir. Aynı şekilde, yayınlanmış makaleler tezlere ya da tezler 
yayınlanmış makalelere dönüşebilir. Tüm bu süreçleri Swales (2004), 
Linell’a 
 
(1998) 
atıf 
yaparak, 
“yeniden 
bağlamlandırma 
(recontextualization)” diye adlandırır. Yeniden bağlanlandırma Linell’a 
(1998) göre bir metnin,  söylemin veya bir türün bir bölümünün ya da bir 
açısının alınarak başka bir bağlama, yani başka bir söylem türüne 
uydurulmasıdır.  
 
Bilimsel alanda belki de en sık karşılaşılan yeniden bağlamlandırma 
olgusu doktora tezleri ve araştırma makaleleri arasındadır. Dong’a (1998) 
göre, yayınlanmaya hazır makalelerden oluşan doktora tezlerinin yaygınlık 
kazanması, bu genel eğilimin bir sonucudur. Doktora tezi genellikle  bir 
doktora programını tamamlamış bir bilim insanın o zamana kadar ürettiği en 
özenli ve en yeni üründür ve bu nedenle de araştırma makalesine 
dönüşebilecek en uygun metindir. Ancak bu süreç, hem yeni bir söylem 
topluluğunda yer bulmanın hem de farklı bir metin türünde yazmanın 
zorlukları ile başa çıkmayı gerektirdiği için oldukça zordur. Anadili 
İngilizce olmayan bilim insanları için ise bu süreç, yabancı bir dilde 
yazmanın zorlukları da eklendiğinde,  çok daha zor olabilir. Ancak, 
akademik makalelerin dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve sözbilimsel 
öğelerinin farkında olmak ve aynı öğelerin kendi ürettikleri tezlerde nasıl 
gerçekleştiğini bilmek, makale yazmak isteyen bilim insanlarının kendi 
alanlarındaki söylem topluluğuna girişlerini kolaylaştıracaktır.  
 
Doktora tezlerinin ve araştırma makalelerinin tür özelliklerini 
inceleyen araştırmalara Tıp ve  Biyoloji gibi alanlarda sıkça rastlanmasına 
rağmen, bu iki yakın tür arasındaki ilişki İngiliz Dili Eğitimi alanında çok 


## Page 281

sınırlı sayıda araştırmanın konusu olmuştur.  Bu çalışma, öncelikle bu 
alandaki araştırma boşluğunu doldurmayı amaçlamıştır. Bu çalışmada 
Türkiye’deki üniversitelerin İngiliz Dili Eğitimi doktora programlarında 
yazılmış tezler ile aynı alandaki uluslararası yazarlar tarafından yazılmış ve 
yayınlanmış bilimsel makalelerin giriş bölümleri dilbilimsel olarak 
incelenmiştir. Bu iki bütünce arasındaki dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve 
sözbilimsel öğelerin karşıtsal çözümlemesi yapılmıştır.  
 
Bu çalışmada özellikle her iki metin türünün giriş bölümleri 
incelenmiştir, çünkü ilgili literatürde de sıkça tartışıldığı gibi, çoğu zaman 
bir yazıya başlamak, devamını getirmekten daha zordur (Swales, 1990; 
Misak et al, 2005). Harwood’a (2005) göre, her gün artan bilimsel yazı 
sayısı göz önüne alındığında, açılış paragraflarının, okuyucuların ilgisini 
çekmesinin, yapılan araştırmanın dikkate alınması için ne kadar önemli 
olduğu anlaşılabilir.   
 
Bu çalışma aşağıdaki üç ana araştırma sorusu çerçevesinde 
yürütülmüştür.  
1- İngiliz Dili Eğitimi alanındaki araştırma makalelerinin giriş 
bölümlerinin türe özgü özellikleri nelerdir? 
2- İngiliz Dili Eğitimi alanındaki doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinin 
türe özgü özellikleri nelerdir? 
3- İngiliz Dili Eğitimi alanındaki araştırma makalelerinin ve doktora 
tezlerinin türe özgü özellikleri ne ölçüde örtüşmektedir?  
 
Her iki metin grubunun aşağıda tanımlanan dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel 
ve sözbilimsel öğeleri ele alınmıştır.  
 
Dilbilgisel-Sözcüksel Öğeler: Bu çalışmada incelenen dilbilgisel-sözcüksel 
öğeler metinlerdeki içerikli, yapısal, akademik sözcük ve sözcük 
dizinlerinin, örnek-örnekçe oranlarının ve etken-edilgen yapıların sıklık 
sayımları ve eylem zamanlarının kullanımını kapsar.  


## Page 282

 
267
 
Metinsel Öğeler: Bu çalışmada metinlerdeki adım yapısı Swales’in (2004) 
CARS Modeline göre çözümlenmiştir. Ayrıca, adımlarda yer alan atıf ve 
dilbilgisel öğeler de incelenmiştir.  
 
Sözbilimsel Öğeler: Bu çalışmada incelenen sözbilimsel öğeler yazarın 
metin içerisindeki varlığı ile ilgili belirticiler ile sınırlıdır.  
 
Bu çalışmada iki bütünce oluşturulmuştur: İngiliz Dili Eğitimi 
alanındaki doktora tezleri ve aynı alandaki araştırma makaleleri. Doktora 
tezleri bütüncesi 83223 kelimeden oluşur. Bütüncedeki 25 tez girişi 2001 ve 
2006 yılları arasında Türkiye’deki 6 İngilizce Eğitimi programında, anadili 
İngilizce olmayan öğrenciler tarafından yazılmıştır. Araştırma makaleleri 
bütüncesi ise 22616 kelimeden oluşur. Bu bütüncede 2001- 2007 yılları 
arasında, İngiliz Dili Eğitimi ile ilgili önemli dergilerde yayınlanmış, çeşitli 
uluslardan yazarlar tarafından yazılmış 25 makalenin giriş bölümü yer alır. 
Bilgisayar destekli çözümleme ve elle işaretleme yöntemleri 
kullanılarak her iki bütüncenin okunurluk istatistikleri, sözcük özellikleri 
(vocabulary profiles), atıf ve eylem zamanlarının kullanımı, adım yapısı ve 
yazarın metin içerisindeki varlığı ile ilgili belirticiler karşıtsal olarak 
çözümlenmiştir.  
Çalışmada elde edilen sonuçlar incelenen doktora tezleri ve bilimsel 
makalelere ait giriş bölümlerinde dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve 
sözbilimsel olarak benzerlikler olduğu gibi, önemli farklar da bulunduğunu 
göstermiştir.  
Çalışmanın sonuçları makalelerin giriş bölümlerinin, tezlerin giriş 
bölümlerine göre, dilbilgisel-sözcüksel olarak daha akademik ve daha yoğun 
olduğunu ve bu nedenle de okunurluk düzeylerinin daha düşük olduğunu 
göstermiştir.

Doktora tezlerindeki giriş bölümlerindeki örnek-örnekçe oranı (type-
token ratio) 0.08 iken, bu oran araştırma makalelerine ait giriş bölümlerinde 
0.13’tür. Doktora tezlerinde her bir örnekçeye 13.03 örnek düşerken, bu sayı 
araştırma makalelerinde 7.54’tür. Bu hesaplamalar göstermiştir ki, araştırma 
makalelerinde, doktora tezlerine oranla daha çok sayıda farklı sözcük 
kullanılmıştır.  
Bu sonuçlar elle işaretleme yöntemi ile elde edilen sonuçlar ile de 
paralellik gösterir. Araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinde, Swales’in 
(2004) CARS Modelinde 3. Adım olarak geçen, “çalışmanın sunumunu 
yapmak” adımında doktora tezlerine göre çok daha fazla sayıda farklı eylem 
kullanılmıştır. Araştırma makaleleri bütüncesinde, “çalışmanın sunumu” 
adımında kullanılan eylemlerin %50.63’ü sadece bir kez kullanılmışken, bu 
oran doktora tezlerinde %44 olarak saptanmıştır.  
Her iki bütüncenin okunurluk düzeylerinin hesaplanması sonucunda, 
araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinin, doktora tezlerinin giriş 
bölümlerine oranla daha uzun paragraflar, tümceler ve sözcükler içerdiği 
görülmüştür. Araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinde her paragrafa 
ortalama 4.9 tümce düşerken, bu oran doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinde 
3.3’tür. Benzer bir farklılık cümle uzunluklarında da tespit edilmiştir. 
Araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinde her tümceye ortalama 29.7 
sözcük düşerken, bu oran doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinde 20.4’tür. 
Aynı biçimde, araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinde ortalama sözcük 
uzunluğu 5.5 iken, bu rakam doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinde 5.3’tür.  
Okunurluk düzeylerindeki farklılığın yanı sıra, doktora tezlerinin ve 
araştırma makalelerinin sözcük profillerinde de önemli farklılıklar 
bulunmuştur. Araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerindeki sözcüklerin  
%10.75’i,  Akademik Kelime Listesinde  (AWL, Coxhead, 2000) yer alan 
kelimelerdir. Bu oran doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinde ise %10.68’dir. 
Bununla birlikte araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerindeki sözcüklerin 
%69.78’i,  K1 (İngilizcede en çok kullanılan ilk bin sözcük) listesindeyken, 


## Page 284

 
269
bu oran doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinde %75.08’dir.  Bu oranlar 
göstermiştir ki, doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerine göre, araştırma 
makalelerinin giriş bölümlerindeki sözcükler daha az sıklıkta rastlanan, daha 
akademik sözcüklerdir.  
Okunurluk düzeylerine ek olarak, doktora tezleri ve araştırma 
makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinin adım yapısında da önemli farklılıklar 
bulunduğu görülmüştür. Bu çalışmadaki araştırma makalelerinin adım yapısı  
Swales’in (2005) CARS Modeli uyumludur. Araştırma makalelerinin 
neredeyse tamamına yakında Swales’in CARS Modelinin 3 temel adımı 
olan (Adım 1: Araştırma alanı oluşturmak (Establishing a territory), Adım 2: 
Daha önceki araştırmalardaki boşluğu saptamak (establishing a niche)  
Adım 3: Çalışmanın sunumunu yapmak (presenting the present work)) 
bulmak mümkündür.  Ancak, benzer bir paralellik incelenen doktora tezleri 
için geçerli değildir. Doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinde yazarlar “2. 
Adım: Daha önceki araştırmalardaki boşluğu saptamak (establising the 
niche)”  adımını neredeyse hiç kullanmamışlardır. Oysa bu adım, neredeyse 
bütün araştırma makalelerinde kullanılmıştır.  
Doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinde yazarlar daha önceki 
araştırmalarla ilgili sorunları ya da eksiklikleri tartışmak yerine,  kendilerini 
bu çalışmayı yapmaya iten etkenleri ve sorunları betimlemeyi tercih 
etmişlerdir. Bunu da üç farklı şekilde gerçekleştirmişlerdir: 1-İngilizce 
eğitimi ile ilgili ulusal sorunsal, 2- İngilizce eğitimi ile ilgili kurumsal 
sorunlar, 3- Çalışma konusuna duyulan kişisel ilgi.  İncelenen doktora 
tezlerindeki İngilizce eğitimi ile ilgili ulusal sorunlara örnek olarak, Türk 
öğrencilerin iletişimsel becerilerdeki eksiklikleri, İngilizce derslerinde 
katılımlarının az olması, İngilizce derslerinde telaffuz konusuna yeterince 
önem verilmemesi gibi sorunlar sıralanabilir. İngilizce eğitimi ile ilgili 
kurumsal sorunlara örnek olarak ise yazarların bağlı bulundukları eğitim 
kurumlarında İngilizce dersi alan öğrencilerin, yazılarında eleştirel düşünme 
becerilerini yeterince kullanamayışları, öğretmenlerin ve öğrencilerin 


## Page 285

 
270
İngilizce eğitimi konusundaki farklı algıları ya da yetersiz İngilizce eğitimi 
malzemeleri verilebilir. Yazarın çalışma konusundaki kişisel ilgisine örnek 
olarak ise, yazarın çok dilli bir sosyal ortamda büyümesi ve bunun İngilizce 
eğitimini nasıl etkilediğini merak etmesi gösterilebilir.  
Okunurluk oranları, sözcük profilleri ve adım yapılarının yanında,  
araştırma makaleleri ve doktora tezlerine ait giriş bölümlerindeki atıfların 
sıklığı, çeşitliliği, atıflarda kullanılan eylem zamanları ve eylemlerde de 
farklılıklar olduğu saptanmıştır. Öncelikle, araştırma makalelerininin giriş 
bölümlerinde, doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerine oranla başka kaynaklara 
çok daha sık atıfta bulunulmuştur. Araştırma makalelerinin giriş 
bölümlerinde her 1.3 cümlede bir kez başka bir kaynağa atıf yapılırken, aynı 
oran doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinde her 7 cümlede birdir.  İkinci 
olarak, araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinin yazarları yaptıkları tüm 
atıfların %62.3’ünde atıf yaptıkları çalışmanın yazarının adını atıf metninin 
içinde geçirmemeyi (non-integral citation) tercih etmişlerdir. Ancak, 
doktora 
tezlerinin 
giriş 
bölümlerinin 
yazarları 
yaptıkları 
atıfların 
%62.2’sinde atıf yaptıkları çalışmanın yazarının ismini doğrudan atıf 
metninin içinde geçirmeyi (integral citation) tercih etmişlerdir. Üçüncü 
olarak, araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinin yazarları yaptıkların 
atıfların %3’ünden az bir bölümünde ikincil atıflara (secondary citation) yer 
vermişlerdir. Doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinde ise bu oran %14.2’dir. 
Son olarak, araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinin yazarları çok az bir 
oranda (%5) doğrudan alıntılara (explicit quotation) yer vermişlerdir. Oysa 
bu oran doktora tezlerinde %14.5’tir.  
Her iki bütüncedeki eylem zamanlarının incelenmesi sonucunda 
doktora tezlerindeki giriş bölümlerindeki eylem zamanlarının sıklığı ve 
kullanım amaçlarının, araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerden farklı 
olduğu görülmüştür. Araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinde eylem 
zamanları daha eşit bir dağılım gösterirken (Geniş Zaman, %60; Geçmiş 
Zaman, %19, Present Perfect, %5, Gelecek Zaman, %1), bu dağılım doktora 


## Page 286

 
271
tezlerinde Geniş Zaman ağırlıklı olmuştur (Geniş Zaman, %86; Geçmiş 
Zaman, %8, Present Perfect, %4, Gelecek Zaman, %2). Bunun yanında, 
doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinin yazarları, araştırma makalelerinin giriş 
bölümlerinin yazarlarından farklı olarak, araştırma sorularında ve 
hipotezlerinde de Geniş Zaman (Simple Present Tense) kullanmayı tercih 
etmişlerdir. Oysa, araştırma makalelerinin yazarlarının büyük bir bölümü 
araştırma sorularında ve hipotezlerinde Geçmiş Zaman (Simple Past Tense) 
kullanmayı tercih etmişlerdir.  
Doktora tezlerinin giriş bölümleri ile araştırma makalelerinin giriş 
bölümlerindeki yazarın metin içerisindeki varlığı ile ilgili belirticilerin (self-
mentions) karşıtsal olarak çözümlenmesi sonuncunda, iki bütünce arasında 
önemli farklar göze çarpmıştır. Araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinde 
yazarların hemen hemen hepsi (25 yazarın 18’i) metin içinde kendi 
varlıklarıyla ilgili belirticiler kullanmışlardır. Doktora tezlerinin giriş 
bölümlerinde ise yazarlar çok daha az bir oranda (25 yazarın, 10’u) 
kendilerinin metin içerisindeki varlığı ile ilgili belirticiler kullanmışlardır. 
Araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümlerinde yazarın metin içerisindeki 
varlığı ile ilgili 31 belirtici kullanılmıştır. Doktora tezlerinin giriş 
bölümlerinde ise bu sayı 21’dir. Kullanım sıklığındaki farkların yanı sıra, 
her iki bütünce arasında yazarların kendilerinin metin içerisindeki varlığı ile 
ilgili olarak kullanmayı tercih ettikleri belirticiler de farklılık göstermiştir. 
Araştırma makalelerinin giriş bölümleri bütüncesinde en sık kullanılan 
belirticiler birinci tekil (Ben) ve çoğul şahıslardır (Biz)  (I , We). Doktora 
tezlerinde ise yazarlar kendilerinin metin içindeki varlıklarını, birinci tekil 
ve çoğul şahısları kullanmak yerine, “(bu)yazar (the/this author))” ya da “ 
(bu) araştırmacı (the/this researcher) belirticilerini kullanmayı tercih 
etmişlerdir.  
İki bütünce arasındaki diğer bir fark ise yazarların metin içerisindeki 
varlıkları ile ilgili belirticileri kullanma amaçları ile ilgilidir. Araştırma 
makaleleri bütüncesinde yazarlar yaptıkları araştırmaların önemini ve 


## Page 287

 
272
biricikliğini ve ortaya attıkları iddiaların kendilerine ait olduğunu 
vurgulamak ve bu iddiaları kişiselleştirmek için kullanmışlardır. Bu 
kullanım Harwood (2005) tarafından “yazarın kendisini övme stratejisi 
“self-promotional strategy” ”  olarak adlandırılır.  Doktora tezlerinin 
yazarları ise, kendilerinin metin içindeki varlıkları ile ilgili belirticileri 
kullanmayı, okuyucuların metni daha rahat takip edebilmeleri için ya da 
araştırmada kullanılan yöntemi anlatmak için  tercih etmişlerdir. Martinez 
(2005) bu tür durumları “risk taşımayan (non-risk)” durumlar olarak 
adlandırmıştır.  
Bu çalışmada bilgisayar destekli hesaplamalı dilbilim ve elle 
işaretleme yöntemleri kullanılarak İngiliz Dili Eğitimi alanındaki doktora 
tezleri ve yayınlanmış araştırma makalelerinden oluşan  iki bütüncenin 
okunurluk istatistikleri, sözcük özellikleri (vocabulary profiles), atıf ve 
eylem zamanlarının kullanımı, adım yapısı ve yazarın metin içerisindeki 
varlığı ile ilgili belirticiler karşıtsal olarak çözümlenmiştir. Çalışmanın 
sonuçları makalelerin giriş bölümlerinin, tezlerin giriş bölümlerine göre, 
dilbilgisel-sözcüksel olarak daha akademik ve daha yoğun olduğunu ve bu 
nedenle de okunurluk düzeylerinin daha düşük olduğunu göstermiştir. 
Ayrıca, CARS Model’in (Swales, 2005) araştırma makalelerinin giriş 
bölümlerinin adım yapısını büyük ölçüde yansıtmasına rağmen, doktora 
tezlerinin giriş bölümlerinin adım yapısını yansıtmadığı görülmüştür. Bu 
farklılıklar bağlamında, İngiliz Dili Eğitimi programlarında eğitim gören 
araştırmacıların daha etkili araştırma makaleleri yazabilmeleri için bazı 
öneriler getirilmiştir. 
Bu çalışmada elde edilen sonuçlar İngiliz Dili Eğitimi alanında 
araştırma makalesi yazmak isteyen, ya da yazdıkları doktora tezlerini 
araştırma makalesi olarak “yeniden bağlamlandırmak (recontextualization)”  
isteyen araştırmalar için faydalı olabilir. Bu amaçla çalışmanın sonuçları, 
İngiliz Dili Eğitimi doktora programlarında verilen eğitimin, programda 
eğitim gören öğrencilerin, ilgili söylem topluluğunun beklentilerine daha 


## Page 288

 
273
etkili bir biçimde karşılık verebilmelerini sağlamaya yönelik olarak 
şekillenmesine de katkıda bulunabilir. Wood’a (2001) göre, bir söylem 
topluluğunda kabul görmenin en önemli şartı, o alandaki uzman yazarlar 
tarafından uygun bulunan şekilde yazmayı öğrenmektir. Rampton’a  (1990) 
göre ise, bir dildeki uzmanlık (doğuştan gelen, bir dili anadil olarak 
konuşmanın tersine) göreceli, kısmi ve öğrenilebilir bir özelliğe sahiptir.  
Pedagojik açıdan, doktora tezleri ve araştırma makalelerinin giriş 
bölümlerini karşıtsal olarak çözümleyen bu çalışmada öne çıkan farklıkların,  
ilgili söylem topluluğuna  yeni adım atan araştırmalar tarafından bilinmesi, 
onları bu toplulukta daha güçlü kılacaktır. Pecorari  (2006) kendi çalışması 
doğrultusunda, doğrudan alıntıların (direct quotation), ya da ikincil atıf 
(secondary citation) gibi konuların çoğu zaman doktora programlarında 
yeterince üzerinde durulmadığını ve bu nedenle öğrencilerin üniversitedeki 
eğitimlerini bu önemli konuları öğrenmeden tamamladıklarına vurgu 
yapmaktadır.  
İngiliz Dili Eğitimi doktora programlarındaki öğrencilerin araştırma 
makalelerinin dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve sözbilimsel öğeleri 
konusundaki farkındalıklarının arttırılması için üç ana yol izlenebilir. 
Birincisi, çıraklık yönetimidir (apprenticeship approach).  Bu yöntemde tez 
yazma aşamasına gelmiş olan doktora öğrencisi ile doktora tezinin 
danışmanı birlikte çalışarak bir araştırma makalesi yazarlar.  Pecorari (2006) 
bu yöntemin araştırma yazılarının dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve 
sözbilimsel öğelerinin doktora öğrencisi tarafından anlaşılması ve 
uygulanmasında en etkili yöntem olduğunu vurgulamıştır.  
İkinci yaklaşım araştırma yazılarının dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel 
ve sözbilimsel öğelerinin İngiliz Dili Eğitimi doktora programının ders 
içeriğine ya da doktora tezinin yazımı sürecine doğrudan entegre 
edilmesidir. (Swales,1987; Pickard, 1995; Swales and Feak, 2004; Li, 2006; 
Peacock, 2006; Charles, in press).    


## Page 289

 
274
 
İkinci yaklaşıma bir örnek olarak Swales (1987) türe dayalı bir proje 
çalışması önermiştir. Swales’in  (1987) önerdiği proje, araştırma makalesi 
metinlerinin içerisinde başka kaynaklara yapılan atıflarla ilgilidir. Ancak, 
benzer bir proje dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve sözbilimsel öğelerin hepsi 
için yürütülebilir. Swales’in (1987) projesinde öğrenciler metin içerisinde 
yapılan atıflarla ilgili niceliksel ve niteliksel bir araştırma yürütürler ilk 
olarak.  Her öğrenci incelediği araştırma makalelerindeki atıflarla ilgili 
dikkatini çeken dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve sözbilimsel öğeler  ile 
ilgili bir günlük tutar. Daha sonra projeye katılan tüm öğrencilerin 
buldukları sonuçlar bir araya getirilir ve araştırma makalelerine özgü genel 
dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve sözbilimsel öğeler saptanır. Tüm özellikler 
bir tabloya dönüştürülür ve öğrenciler yazmaya başladıkları kendi araştırma 
makalelerinde bu tablodan yararlanırlar.  Metin içindeki atıflarla ilgili bu 
proje, sözcük özellikleri (vocabulary profiles), atıf ve eylem zamanlarının 
kullanımı, adım yapısı ve yazarın metin içerisindeki varlığı ile ilgili diğer 
konularla ilgili de yürütülebilir.  
 
Araştırma yazılarının dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve sözbilimsel 
öğelerinin İngiliz Dili Eğitimi doktora programının ders içeriğine ya da 
doktora tezinin yazımı sürecine doğrudan entegre edilmesinin diğer bir yolu 
da, bu tezde yürütülen çalışmaya benzer bir çalışmanın doktora öğrencisi 
tarafından yürütülmesidir. Bu tezde kullanılan bilgisayar programları 
kullanılarak ve elde işaretleme yöntemi ile doktora öğrencileri kendi 
yazılarındaki ve uzman yazarlar tarafından yazılmış ve yayınlanmış 
araştırma yazılarındaki arasındaki dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve 
sözbilimsel öğelerin neler olduğunu bulabilir ve bu iki tür arasında bir 
kıyaslama yapabilirler. 
Swales ve Feak (2004), araştırma yazılarında sıkça kullanılan 
dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve sözbilimsel öğeler ile ilgili olarak bir kitap 
yazmışlardır. Bu kitap özellikle CARS (Swales, 2004) Modelin etkili bir 
biçimde araştırma yazılarında kullanılabilmesi için gerekli bilgiyi ve 


## Page 290

 
275
alıştırmaları içermektedir. CARS Modelin her adımının dilbilgisel-
sözcüksel, metinsel ve sözbilimsel öğelerini de içeren bu kitap İngiliz Dili 
Eğitimi doktora programının ders içeriğine bir kaynak olarak dahil 
edilebilir.  
Pedagojik açıdan, doktora tezleri ve araştırma makalelerinin giriş 
bölümlerini karşıtsal olarak çözümleyen bu çalışmada öne çıkan farklıkların,  
ilgili söylem topluluğuna  yeni adım atan araştırmalar tarafından bilinmesini 
sağlayabilecek başka bir yol ise İngiliz Dili Eğitimi doktora programlarının, 
tezlerin söylem düzeni ile ilgili beklentilerini değiştirmesi olabilir. İngiliz 
Dili Eğitimi doktora programlarında öğrenciler, geleneksel olarak, giriş, 
yöntem, sonuçlar gibi bölümler içeren tezler yerine, yayınlanmaya hazır 
makalelerden oluşan tezler (Article Compilation Thesis) (Dong, 1998; 
Paltridge, 2002) yazabilirler. Araştırma makalelerinin bir araya gelmesinden 
oluşan bu tez türündeki bölümler, geleneksel tezlere göre daha özdür ve 
yazarın bildiklerini göstermesine daha az olanak tanır. Bunun yanında bu tez 
türünde hedeflenen okuyucu da, geleneksel tezlerde hedeflenen okuyucudan 
farklıdır. Dong (1998) yayınlanmaya hazır makalelerden oluşan tezleri 
yazarlarken, öğrencilerin akademiye hitaben yazmaktan çok, kendileri ile 
aynı uzmanlığa sahip meslektaşlarının okuması için yazabileceklerini 
belirtir. 
Bu çalışmada Türkiye’deki üniversitelerin İngiliz Dili Eğitimi 
doktora programlarında yazılmış tezler ile aynı alandaki uluslararası 
yazarlar tarafından yazılmış ve yayınlanmış bilimsel makalelerin giriş 
bölümleri dilbilimsel olarak incelenmiştir ve bu iki bütünce arasındaki 
dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, 
metinsel 
ve 
sözbilimsel 
öğelerin 
karşıtsal 
çözümlemesi yapılmıştır.  Bu nedenle bu tezde elde edilen sonuçlar daha 
çok Türkiye’deki üniversitelerin İngiliz Dili Eğitimi doktora programlarında 
kayıtlı Türk öğrenciler ve araştırmacılar için geçerli olabilir. Bundan sonra 
yapılacak çalışmalarda farklı ülkelerdeki, farklı uluslardan öğrencilerin 
yazdıkları tezlerin ve farklı uluslardan yazarların yazdığı araştırma 


## Page 291

 
276
makalelerinin de incelenmesi ile, bu çalışmada elde edilen sonuçlar daha 
fazla genellenebilir. Bunun yanında, İngiliz Dili Eğitimi ile ilgili farklı 
bilimsel dergilerin, yayınlamaya değer buldukları araştırma makalelerinin 
dilbilgisel-sözcüksel, metinsel ve sözbilimsel öğelerinin karşıtsal olarak 
incelenmesi de bu tezde ele edilen sonuçlara katkıda bulunacaktır.
