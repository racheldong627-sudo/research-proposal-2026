Abstract
Objective  ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is an artificial intelligence language tool developed by OpenAI 
that utilises machine learning algorithms to generate text that closely mimics human language. It has recently taken the 
internet by storm. There have been several concerns regarding the accuracy of documents it generates. This study compares 
the accuracy and quality of several ChatGPT-generated academic articles with those written by human authors.
Material and methods  We performed a study to assess the accuracy of ChatGPT-generated radiology articles by comparing 
them with the published or written, and under review articles. These were independently analysed by two fellowship-trained 
musculoskeletal radiologists and graded from 1 to 5 (1 being bad and inaccurate to 5 being excellent and accurate).
Results  In total, 4 of the 5 articles written by ChatGPT were significantly inaccurate with fictitious references. One of the 
papers was well written, with a good introduction and discussion; however, all references were fictitious.
Conclusion  ChatGPT is able to generate coherent research articles, which on initial review may closely resemble authentic 
articles published by academic researchers. However, all of the articles we assessed were factually inaccurate and had ficti-
tious references. It is worth noting, however, that the articles generated may appear authentic to an untrained reader.

Introduction
ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) language tool 
developed by OpenAI that utilises machine learning algo-
rithms to generate text that closely mimics human language 
[1]. ChatGPT has been trained on large amounts of data 
to improve its ability to understand and generate natural-
language text and can comprehend and respond to natural-
language inputs. A tool of this calibre has the ability to 
influence a diverse array of sectors. In the field of research, 
ChatGPT has demonstrated the ability to generate scientific 
papers that are similar to authentic papers written by aca-
demic researchers, which has raised many questions about 
its potential role in the future of academic research. Several 
concerns, however, have been raised regarding the accuracy 
of research texts generated by ChatGPT [2, 3]. This study 
aims to assess the accuracy of radiology research articles 
generated by ChatGPT by performing a comparison with 
authentic, published articles or those under review.
Materials and methods
Five randomly selected articles published prior to 2021 or 
written and under review by senior authors were selected. 
ChatGPT was asked to write the articles with references. 
ChatGPT version 3.0 was used. These were then indepen-
dently compared by two fellowship-trained musculoskeletal 
radiologists with the published articles. The references gen-
erated were cross-referenced with scientific databases (Pub-
Med, Google, and Ovid Medline) to assess for authenticity.
