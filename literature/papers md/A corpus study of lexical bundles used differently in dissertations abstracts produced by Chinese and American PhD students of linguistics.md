This study examined lexical bundles (LBs) used differently by Chinese and American
PhD students of linguistics in their dissertation abstracts. Two corpora were built,
with each having 700 dissertation abstracts produced by Chinese and American PhD
students of linguistics, respectively. The study then used lexical analysis software to
retrieve frequently used three-word LBs, from which LBs having different frequencies
at a signiﬁcant level across the two corpora were identiﬁed and termed as bundles
used differently (BUDs). BUDs were then categorized and analyzed manually in terms
of structure, function, and distribution in rhetorical moves. The major ﬁndings were: (1)
57.14% of the frequently used LBs were BUDs, of which 90.67% had occurrences
in both corpora. The BUDs distributed inequivalently across categories and moves,
with the text-oriented category and the move of Result having the most BUDs; and
(2) BUDs exhibited two major patterns: the Chinese and American students ﬁlled
different constituents into structurally and functionally similar constructions, and used
LBs of dissimilar functions to fulﬁll the same communicative purposes. These ﬁndings
indicate that variations in LB use have a high pedagogic value and conﬁrm the need for
using corpora to identify and teach core genre-speciﬁc vocabularies to second/foreign
language learners.

INTRODUCTION
Formulaic language has received increasing attention from linguistics researchers over the past
3 decades. Despite an inconsistency of terminologies, such as constructions (Fillmore, 1988),
idiomatic expressions (Titone and Connine, 1999), and LBs (Biber et al., 1999), a consensus has
been reached that a substantial proportion of our language in use is comprised by formulaic
language (Schmitt and Carter, 2004). Research shows that “stored and retrieved whole” (Wray,
2002, p. 9) multi-word items, an important type of formulaic language, account for as much
as 58.60% of English-spoken discourse and 52.30% of written discourse (Erman and Warren,
2000), and are, therefore, “important building blocks of discourse in spoken and written registers”

Lexical Bundles in Dissertation Abstracts
(Biber and Barbieri, 2007, p. 263). Research reveals that learners
process formulaic sequences in a considerably shorter reaction
time than they process non-formulaic ones in reading (Jiang and
Nekrasova, 2007) and speaking (Lin, 2010).
Formulaic language competence is increasingly considered as
an indicator of language proﬁciency (Cortes, 2004). In academic
prose, the mastery of discipline-speciﬁc sequences demonstrates
membership of a discourse community (Segalowitz, 2010; Ädel
and Erman, 2012). Formulaic language is particularly important
for L2 (second language) learners because “it reduces the learning
burden while maximizing communicative ability” (Ellis, 1994,
p. 86). Learning formulaic sequences can eﬀectively promote
learners’ genre competence by oﬀering ready-made sets of items
to work with (Myles, 2004; Coxhead and Byrd, 2007), and
allows them to use language with “a single mental eﬀort”
(Hunston, 2002, p. 174). Formulaic language, therefore, has
high pedagogic value for English for academic purpose (EAP)
instruction for L2 learners.
Lexical bundles (LBs), as an important component of
formulaic language, are “sequences of words that commonly go
together in natural discourse” (Biber and Conrad, 1999, p. 184).
The deﬁning features of LBs are non-idiomaticity, structural
incompleteness, and frequency-driven identiﬁcation, with which
LB research extends to linguistic items rarely captured with
conventional approaches. For instance, in this dissertation I is a
four-word LB used by American PhD students to present goals of
research projects. The sequence, however, is rarely identiﬁed by
traditional phraseology due to its grammatical incompleteness.
LBs have been widely examined across EAP contexts,
including textbooks (e.g., Biber et al., 2004; Liu and Chen, 2020),
research papers across diﬀerent disciplines (e.g., Cortes, 2004;
Hyland, 2008a,b), research papers or essays produced by L1 (ﬁrst
language) and L2 English writers (e.g., Chen and Baker, 2010;
Pan et al., 2016; Bychkovska and Lee, 2017), and so on. LBs
in abstracts have been examined mainly in L1 and L2 English
writers’ research articles (RAs) (e.g., Hu and Huang, 2017; Liu and
Lu, 2019; Kim and Lee, 2021), whereas those in other genres, such
as conference (e.g., Wongwiwat, 2016) and dissertation abstracts
(e.g., Lu and Deng, 2019), have been inadequately researched.
Dissertations and RAs are distinct genres and use language
diﬀerently (Hyland, 2008a; El-Dakhs, 2020). Coupled with the
rapidly rising number of graduate students who are going to
be professionals and need to write in English in diﬀerent areas
in China (e.g., the number of new graduate students was over
1.1 million in 2021, while it was around 0.5 million in 2016),
use of LBs in dissertation abstracts, which are the only section
required to be written in English as well in most disciplines,
deserves research.
In addition, the current LB literature approaches diﬀerent use
of LBs primarily by comparing LBs beyond a frequency cut-
oﬀ, but rarely by directly examining those having signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent frequencies across corpora. For instance, Dahunsi and
Ewata (2022) compared three-word LBs having 50 or more
occurrences in L1 and L2 writers’ texts, showing diﬀerent
structural patterns and colligational characteristics. Their results
revealed certain features of LBs used by L1 and L2 writers (e.g., L2
writers used a greater number/proportion of LBs within a certain
structure than L1 writers), but did not comprehensively reveal
what LBs were used with frequencies diﬀerent at a signiﬁcant
level by the two groups. It is often assumed that shared bundles
in L1 and L2 corpora have often been learned or acquired by L2
learners, while the bundles used (signiﬁcantly) diﬀerently often
indicate L2 leaners’ tendency to use the bundles that they have
accustomed/trained to and inability to freely employ the bundles
frequently used by L1 speakers. Thus, LBs used signiﬁcantly
diﬀerently by L1 and L2 learners are more useful to L2 learners in
that they represent items to be speciﬁcally noticed in L2 learners’
academic writing to enhance its genre-nativeness. Consequently,
the present research seeks to examine the LBs used diﬀerently
by Chinese and American PhD students of linguistics in their
dissertation abstracts, hoping to help teach and learn this speciﬁc
genre more eﬀectively.
STUDIES ON LEXICAL BUNDLES
LBs are “recurrent expressions, regardless of their idiomaticity,
and regardless of their structural status” (Biber et al., 1999,
p. 990). LBs have transparent meanings interpretable by their
individual components (Liu and Chen, 2020), and, therefore,
perform categorical discourse functions (Oakey, 2020) and fulﬁll
particular pragmatic purposes (Biber et al., 2004).
LB research often uses pre-deﬁned taxonomies to categorize
and analyze LBs in terms of structure, function, as well
as communicative purpose. Popular structural (Table 1) and
functional taxonomies (Table 2) are proposed by Biber et al.
(1999) and Hyland (2008a) for LBs in academic discourse,
respectively. In addition, Swales and Feak’s (2009) ﬁve-move
model (Table 3) has been used in research on LBs in abstracts.
LB researchers generally adopt/adapt these models according to
the scope and need of their studies.
Comparative LB research, when at its birth, often compared
LBs beyond a frequency cut-oﬀacross corpora. For example,
Biber et al. (1999) conducted the ﬁrst LB research and found
that LBs in conversation mainly consisted of clause segments,

including declarative structures (e.g., I don’t know what) and
interrogative structures (e.g., what are your doing), and that
those in academic prose mainly consisted of nominal (e.g., the
end of the) or prepositional elements (e.g., on the basis of ).
Later, LB studies began to compare LBs frequently used across
corpora, featuring diﬀerent registers (e.g., Biber, 2006; Biber
and Barbieri, 2007; Huang, 2018), disciplines (e.g., Cortes, 2004;
Hyland, 2008b; Liu and Chen, 2020), genres (e.g., Cortes, 2004;
Hyland, 2008a; Gao, 2017), and writer groups (e.g., Nekrasova,
2009; Chen and Baker, 2010; Ädel and Erman, 2012).
Most research on abstracts focuses on LBs in RAs across
rhetorical moves (e.g., Omidian et al., 2018; Abdollahpour
and Gholami, 2019; Qi and Pan, 2020) and written by L1
and L2 English writers (e.g., Niu, 2014; Hu, 2015; Hu and
Huang, 2017), revealing distributional patterns of LBs used
diﬀerently across corpora. Several recent studies have examined
LBs in dissertation abstracts. Lu and Deng (2019) compared
LBs in 13,596 and 4,755 dissertation abstracts produced by PhD
students of all available disciplines at Tsinghua University and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, respectively. The results
showed substantial frequency diﬀerences of LBs in structural
and functional categories (e.g., the Chinese and American
students used 1,640.83 and 786.87 tokens of VP-based LBs per
million words, respectively). Similar results were achieved by

Lyu and Gee (2020) who compared thesis abstracts written by
Chinese and American master students of culture, linguistics,
literature, and pedagogy. Li et al. (2020) conducted a bundle-
driven analysis to reveal sentence initial LBs in rhetorical moves
of dissertation abstracts produced by British PhD students of
arts and humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and physics.
The study identiﬁed a new rhetorical move—structure. Even so,
research on LBs in dissertation abstracts is still limited.
Probably because of complexity, little research has specially
investigated LBs used with frequencies diﬀerent at a signiﬁcant
level across corpora, which helps reveal what and how certain
LBs are used diﬀerently across corpora. Hence, what LBs are
used diﬀerently for the same functions and communicative
purposes is still inadequately researched. This study deﬁnes LBs
used diﬀerently as items whose frequencies are diﬀerent at a
signiﬁcant level (p < 0.05) across corpora, as shown by the
log-likelihood (LL) value equal to or greater than 3.84. LL tests
perform eﬀectively particularly in comparing the frequencies of
low-frequency items across corpora of diﬀerent sizes (Dunning,
1993; Rayson and Garside, 2000), and are considered “useful
for comparing the relative frequency of words or phrases”
(Simpson-Vlach and Ellis, 2010, p. 492). Despite its limitation
suggested by Bestgen (2017), the LL statistics has been widely
used in LB or n-gram studies (e.g., Simpson-Vlach and Ellis,
2010; Ädel and Erman, 2012; Du, 2013; Pan et al., 2016;
Bychkovska and Lee, 2017; Hu and Huang, 2017; Hyland and
Jiang, 2018, 2021; Lu and Deng, 2019; Jiang and Hyland,
2022).
The LBs used diﬀerently by L1 and L2 English writers often
indicate L2 learners’ tendency to use the bundles that they have
accustomed/trained to and inability to freely employ the bundles
frequently used by L1 speakers. Thus, knowledge of diﬀerently
used bundles is useful to instructors who can use the knowledge
to formulate an appropriate pedagogy to help L2 learners use a
more variety of LBs in their academic writing and thus enhance

its genre-nativeness. English has become “global lingua franca
of academia” (Mauranen et al., 2010, p. 183) that “is no one’s
ﬁrst language” (Hyland, 2019, p. 19). Hence, appropriate use of
commonly used formulaic English in dissertation abstracts can
help promote Chinese PhD students’ readership and academic
inﬂuence in the international academic community (Hu and
Huang, 2021).
All these motivated the present research, which aimed to
identify the proﬁles of LBs used diﬀerently at a signiﬁcant level
by Chinese and American PhD students in their linguistics
dissertation abstracts and examine how they are used diﬀerently
by the two groups. And the following two research questions were
formulated:
(1) What are the proﬁles of LBs used diﬀerently in dissertation
abstracts produced by Chinese and American PhD students
of linguistics?
a. What are the forms and frequencies of the LBs used
diﬀerently in the two corpora?
b. What are the functional and rhetorical move distributions
of the LBs used diﬀerently in the two corpora?
(2) How do the two groups use diﬀerent LBs to achieve
the same functions and communicative purposes in their
dissertation abstracts?
a. How are LBs used for the same functions in the two
corpora?
b. How are LBs used for the same communicative purposes in
the two corpora?
RESEARCH DESIGN
Corpora
We ﬁrst searched for dissertations completed by Chinese PhD
students of linguistics between 2000 and 2020 from 13 Chinese
universities via China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the
National Library of China, and relevant university libraries.
All the universities were qualiﬁed to reward doctoral degrees
and tier-1 universities recognized by the Ministry of Education
of the People’s Republic of China. The time frame covered a
substantial proportion of the genre given that many of the
PhD programs in China were founded around 2000. Finally, we
gathered 700 dissertation abstracts and established the Chinese
University Linguistics Dissertation Abstracts Collection (CUC),
which had an overall token of 613,713 and a mean token of
876.73 (SD = 509.44).
To parallel with Chinese universities, high-ranking American
universities on 2020 QS World University Rankings by linguistics
were selected. Seven hundred dissertations abstracts completed
by PhD students of linguistics from these 13 universities in the
same time frame were gathered via ProQuest and university
libraries to establish the American University Linguistics
Dissertation Abstracts Collection (AUC). It had an overall token
of 247,359 and a mean token of 353.37 (SD = 124.63). The source
universities and amounts of the sample texts are presented in the
Supplementary Material.
Data Analyzing Framework
Identifying LBs
The present research focused on three-word LBs because they
are considerably more frequent than four- and ﬁve-word LBs
(Hyland, 2008a) and the focus of many existing LB studies (e.g.,
Hu, 2015; Huang, 2018; Azad and Khiabani, 2018). A consistent
selection of length promotes comparability. This study used the
WordSmith Tools 8.0 (Scott, 2020) to retrieve three-word LBs
based on a cut-oﬀpoint of 60 occurrences per million words
(pmw) in at least 2% (14 texts in CUC and AUC, respectively) of
the sample texts. This study adopted a relatively higher frequency
cut-oﬀpoint because the dispersion rate is a more salient
parameter in research concerning abstracts that are generally
mini texts. In this study, for instance, an adoption of Hyland
(2008a,b) 10% dispersion rate entailed 283 occurrences pmw for
AUC, and 114 for CUC, which yielded less than 30 items. We,
therefore, adopted 2% dispersion cut-oﬀ, which was 14 texts and
thus 60 occurrences pmw. The cut-oﬀpoint was consistent with
and even stricter than Lu and Deng’s (2019) 20 occurrences and
2.70–9.70h, and Omidian et al.’s (2018) 20 occurrences and
5.10h parameters.
After the retrieval, the overlapping items were combined with
the approach proposed by Chen and Baker (2010) to reduce
frequency inﬂation. The LBs underlying complete subsumption
where two or more LBs overlapped and one LB subsumed the
other(s) were combined (e.g., as well as subsumed all occurrences
of well as the and well as a that were, therefore, combined
into as well as). Those underlying complete overlaps where two
three-word LBs were actually one four-word LBs were combined
into longer items (e.g., all tokens of it is argued and is argued
that were largely similar and, therefore, were combined into it
is argued that).
To identify LBs whose frequencies varied at a signiﬁcant
level across CUC and AUC, we used Rayson’s (2016) Eﬀect Size
Calculator to yield the LL values. LBs of LL values greater than
3.84 (p < 0.05) were recognized as bundles used diﬀerently
(BUDs). BUDs of a signiﬁcantly greater frequency in CUC were
identiﬁed as CUC BUDs and those in AUC as AUC BUDs.
We also used the Eﬀect Size Calculator to identify LBs of a
signiﬁcantly greater frequency in a rhetorical move than in a
whole text. LBs with LL values greater than 3.84 (p < 0.05) were
recognized as move-speciﬁc bundles and considered a key to
constructing a speciﬁc move, given their speciﬁc occurrences.
Categorizing LBs
This study categorized LBs in terms of their structure, function,
and distribution in rhetorical moves. The working structural
taxonomy, functional taxonomy, and the rhetorical moves,
as well as communicative purposes, are provided in the
Supplementary Material.
Structurally, we used Biber et al.’s (1999) taxonomy developed
speciﬁcally for academic prose, and conducted modiﬁcations to
enhance its relevance to the current genre. For instance, we
replaced the noun + verb phrases + that-clause with subject + verb
phrases + (that-clause) to account for a considerable number of
AUC items containing ﬁrst person singular I.

Lexical Bundles in Dissertation Abstracts
Functionally, we used Hyland’s (2008a) functional taxonomy
developed speciﬁcally for LBs in RAs and dissertations, and
added new sub-categories, including relationship signals (LBs
denoting relationships between entities, such as is consistent
with), objective signals (LBs denoting objectives, such as in
order to), and other bundles. We also promoted inferential
and causative signals to sub-categories within the text-oriented
category. To reduce subjectivity on functional categorization,
a PhD student of linguistics was employed to categorize LBs
independently with the researcher. Our Cohen’s Kappa coeﬃcient
was 0.889 (k > 0.80), indicating an excellent strength of inter-
coder agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977). For LBs whose
functions were disagreed upon, the two coders went through and
discussed the items until they reached complete consensus.
With regard to rhetorical moves, we used Swales and Feak’s
(2009) ﬁve-move model and followed Li et al. (2020) to add the
move of structure that speciﬁcally outlined dissertation structures
found in many CUC and AUC texts in the present study. Based
on the model, the two researchers identiﬁed moves and their
communicative purposes independently, with a Kappa coeﬃcient
of 0.813. We then went through and discussed the disagreed-
upon items until we reached complete consensus.
Analyzing LBs
As discussed, we identiﬁed LBs frequently used in the two corpora
via WordSmith Tools 8.0 (Scott, 2020), with a cut-oﬀpoint of
60 occurrences pmw in at least 2% of the sample texts. We
then identiﬁed BUDs from the LBs frequently used by their LL
value (LL value ≥3.84, p < 0.05), with Rayson’s (2016) Eﬀect
Size Calculator.
To reveal how LBs were used diﬀerently in the two corpora,
we examined the structures of BUDs in the same functional
categories to determine whether the BUDs of the same functions
resulted from diﬀerent structures. Instead of analyzing tokens
of BUDs serving diﬀerent functions in rhetorical moves, we
analyzed the functions of BUDs identiﬁed as move-speciﬁc
bundles, serving the same communicative purposes in rhetorical
moves, because: (1) rhetorical moves in dissertation abstracts are
often more informative than those in RAs in that dissertation
abstracts are considerably longer and contain LBs, serving various
communicative purposes; and (2) move-speciﬁc bundles are key
items used to construct moves whose occurrences have move-
speciﬁc features.
RESULTS
Proﬁles of Bundles Used Differently in
the Two Corpora
Forms and Frequencies
According to the cut-oﬀpoint, 274 bundle types with 20,154
tokens and 195 types with 5,798 tokens were identiﬁed in CUC
and AUC, respectively, as shown in Table 4 (full lists are in
the Supplementary Material). In terms of token frequency, the
Chinese students used a substantially greater number of LBs than
their American counterparts (LL value = 543.41, p < 0.0001).
Regarding bundle forms, only 101 bundle types were shared in the
two corpora, suggesting that 63.14% of the bundle types frequent
in CUC were not frequent in AUC, and that 48.21% of the
bundle types frequent in AUC were not frequent in CUC. These
results indicated substantial variations across CUC and AUC
with regard to both frequencies and forms. The LBs frequently
used by the Chinese and American students were, therefore,
considerably dissimilar.
Of the frequently used LBs, 268 BUDs that represented the
LBs used diﬀerently by the two groups were identiﬁed. Of the
268 BUDs, 175 were CUC BUDs, indicating that 63.87% of the
LBs frequently used in CUC had signiﬁcantly greater frequencies
than those in AUC; 93 were AUC BUDs, indicating that 47.69% of
those in AUC had signiﬁcantly greater frequencies than those in
CUC. It should be noted that 157 of the 175 (89.71%) CUC BUDs
had occurrences in both collections, and the proportion was 86
of 93 (92.47%) for AUC BUDs. These results showed that the
Chinese and American PhD students of linguistics might draw on
a quite similar formulaic language resource but with substantially
dissimilar frequencies.
Distribution in Functional Categories and Rhetorical
Moves
As shown in Table 5, the greatest number of BUDs occurred
in the text-oriented category, followed by the research- and
participant-oriented categories, and description bundles had the
largest number of BUDs, followed by framing and structuring
signals. It should be noted that inferential signals had 15 AUC,
yet only three CUC BUDs, and that inferential and causative
signals were the only two categories that had more AUC than
CUC BUDs. Meanwhile, topic bundles had 14 CUC BUDs but no
AUC BUDs; transition signals had seven CUC BUDs but only one
AUC BUD. These results revealed an inequivalent distribution
of BUDs across all the three functional categories and their
15 subcategories.
Table 6 shows that the greatest number of BUD tokens
occurred within the move of Result, followed by moves of
Methodology and Goal. These results suggested that the Chinese
and American students used substantially diﬀerent LBs to present
results, designs, and purposes of their research projects. It should
be noted that the moves of Result and Goal were the only two
rhetorical moves that had a greater proportion of AUC than CUC
BUDs, while the move of Background had 16.16% of CUC yet
only 7.27% of AUC BUDs. These ﬁndings indicated the Chinese
students’ heavy reliance on formulaic language in composing
their dissertation abstracts.
Analyses of BUDs in the Two Corpora
BUDs Within Functional Categories
Figure 1 presents the structural distribution of BUDs in the three
major functional categories. As shown in Figure 1A, the CUC
BUDs fell into ten subcategories, whereas the AUC BUDs fell
into ﬁve categories. Four structural categories, including noun
phrase + of, noun phrase with other post modiﬁer fragments,
other noun phrase fragment, and pronoun/noun phrase + be,
contained both CUC and AUC BUDs and accounted for 84.13%
of all BUD tokens within the research-oriented category. The
structural categories speciﬁc to AUC and CUC BUDs, including

These results suggested that BUDs in the two corpora fell into
substantially similar structural categories, meaning that what led
to the two groups’ diﬀerent use of LBs with respect to structure
was mainly diﬀerent constituents ﬁlled in the functionally and
structurally similar constructions, but not diﬀerent structures
used to construct LBs of the same functions.
We then analyzed the constituents ﬁlled into the same
structures of BUDs within the same functional categories. Table 7
shows ﬁve typical pairs of CUC and AUC BUDs, which had
the same structures and functions. For example, within location
bundles, the Chinese students were more likely to use (in) the
process of, whereas the American students used (over) the course
of to refer to a time period. In Ex. 1 and Ex. 2, both BUDs
collocated with years in similar contexts.

Ex. 2. The ﬁeldwork for this study was conducted over the
course of 7 years. (AUC).
Likewise, within description bundles, while the Chinese
students tended to refer to the meaning of lexical items by
the meaning of, their American counterparts more often used
the semantics of. The two BUDs usually occurred in the same
contexts, as shown in Ex. 3 and 4. The same pattern was

identiﬁed with many other pairs of BUDs within description
bundles commonly used by the Chinese and American students,
respectively, including features of the and properties of the,
characteristics of the and the nature of, and the framework of and
a model of.
Ex. 3. . . .a “semantic mismatch” between the meaning of the
lexical items. . . (CUC).
Ex. 4. . . .a single underlying diﬀerence in the semantics of
these lexical items. . . (AUC).
Analyses showed that, within inferential signals, the Chinese
students used more ﬁnd as in it is found, but the American
students used more argue and show as in it is argued/shown in
anticipatory it + verb/adjective phrase structure. These results
indicated the Chinese students’ particular and even exclusive
preference for using ﬁnd to report research results. In contrast,
the American students used a much wider range of verbs,
including argue, show, propose, suggest, indicate, demonstrate,
and propose, whose occurrences in CUC inferential signals were
all signiﬁcantly fewer. Despite the semantic diﬀerences of these
verbs, ﬁnd might be the ﬁrst and most prototypical reporting verb
learned and used by many Chinese students who thus felt more
conﬁdent with the verb (Li et al., 2018). Within inferential signals
of subject + verb phrase + (that-clause) structure, the Chinese
students primarily used we ﬁnd that and strictly avoided using
LBs containing the ﬁrst person singular I to reduce authorial
stance, while these bundles were the most common inferential
signals used by the American students. Table 8 shows a total of
10 AUC LBs containing authorial I, which were all AUC BUDs.
These items had 1,827 tokens pmw in AUC, yet only 21 tokens in
CUC. They accounted for 31.51% of the total AUC bundle tokens
and were, therefore, the most important bundle group in AUC in
this regard. The tokens of the most common I-bundle I argue that
alone made up 3.24% of all bundle tokens in AUC. Functionally,
the bundles fell into inferential signals and procedure bundles
that indicated writers’ intellectual aspects in research. Meanwhile,
9 of the 10 items were move-speciﬁc bundles and thus a key to
the construction of speciﬁc rhetorical moves, including moves
of AUC Result and Methodology. The I-bundles were, therefore,
crucially important to the American students but strictly avoided
by the Chinese students in the subject + verb phrase + (that-
clause) structure.
Meanwhile, the Chinese students used signiﬁcantly more
structuring signals (LL value = 46.19, p < 0.0001), such as the
CUC BUD the present study, as sentence subjects. The subjects
of move-speciﬁc bundles were primarily this dissertation as in
this dissertation examines in AUC Goal and the dissertation
as in the dissertation is in Structure. This ﬁnding showed the
American students’ more ﬂexible use of subjects to implicitly
mark move boundaries and their attempts to highlight individual
contributions to the design and results of their projects.
Within structuring signals, the American students consistently
used dissertation as in in this dissertation, whereas the Chinese
students used more often study as in in this study, research as
the present research, and dissertation as in the present dissertation
to refer to doctoral research. Many BUDs in this category
exhibited this feature, including AUC BUDs of the dissertation,
this dissertation presents, as well as this dissertation is, and

the CUC BUDs in this research, present study has, and this
study is. The diﬀerence might reﬂect the Chinese students’
relative unfamiliarity with and, therefore, reluctance to use
dissertation that speciﬁcally denoted doctoral research. The
same pattern was identiﬁed within causative signals where the
Chinese students tended to use ﬁnding, while the American
students primarily relied on result, which was reﬂected in the
CUC BUDs the ﬁndings of and ﬁndings of the, and the AUC
BUD the results of. The Chinese students might use ﬁndings to
emphasize their active eﬀorts to ﬁnd facts, whose subtle meaning
could not be communicated by result. These ﬁndings indicate
the two writer groups’ diﬀerent choices of words within the
same structures.
BUDs Within Rhetorical Moves
Figure 2 presents the functional distribution of move-speciﬁc
bundles in the communicative purposes that had most LBs in
each of its six sub-moves. The communicative purposes included
introducing previous studies (A), presenting purposes of research
(B), displaying research acts (C), reporting results of research (D),
demonstrating beneﬁciaries of research (E), and stating contents
of chapters (F).
In Background, both groups used most LBs to achieve
the communicative purpose of introducing previous studies
where 11 BUDs were identiﬁed. As shown in Figure 2A, the
Chinese students used a much wider functional variety of LBs
that included description bundles (e.g., the previous studies),
quantiﬁcation bundles (e.g., most of the), framing signals (e.g.,
the ﬁeld of ), and procedure bundles (e.g., the research on). The
American students only used framing signals (e.g., the ﬁeld of )
and causative signals (e.g., it has been). Similarly, to emphasize
the importance of their research, the Chinese students used
quantiﬁcation bundles (e.g., a lot of ), stance feature bundles (e.g.,
the most important), and transition signals (e.g., is not only),
whereas the American students only used quantiﬁcation bundles
(e.g., one of the).
Figure 2B indicates both groups’ marked reliance on objective
signals to present research purposes in Goal. In CUC, 84.21%
of the move-speciﬁc bundles were objective signals, which were
50% for AUC. This diﬀerence indicated the Chinese students’
heavier reliance on objective signals to present research aims.
Instead, the American students showed marked reliance on
structuring signals that made up 40% of the move-speciﬁc
bundles, which were rarely used by the Chinese students. Ex.
5 and 6 show the two groups’ typical use of objective and
structuring signals in this regard, which shows that the American
students’ use of structuring signals commonly followed the
pattern this dissertation + investigates/examines/presents/explores,
while the Chinese students primarily relied on objective signals,
such as study aims to that contained the verb aim, communicating
a more explicit meaning of purposes.
Ex. 5. This dissertation explores the role of aﬀect in
sociolinguistic style. (AUC GOAL).
Ex. 6. The present study aims to explore the use of
anaphora. (CUC GOAL).
The Chinese students’ greater reliance on objective signals
was also identiﬁed in displaying research acts in Methodology.
Figure 2C shows that 66.67% of the CUC move-speciﬁc bundles
fell into objective signals, which were only 16.67% for AUC.
The American students used 66.67% of the items as procedure
bundles that only accounted for 33.33% in CUC. The procedure
bundles used by the American students commonly followed
the pattern I + examine/focus on the in an active voice (Ex.
7). In comparison, objective signals, such as to analyze the,
which fell into to-clause structure were commonly used by
the Chinese students in a passive voice (Ex. 8). In addition,
in description of research design in Methodology, the CUC
items consisted of framing signals (55.56%), procedure bundles
(22.22%), and quantiﬁcation bundles (22.22%), while the AUC
items fell equivalently into location bundles, framing signals,
and quantiﬁcation bundles. The Chinese students, therefore, used
considerably more framing signals for the purpose. Ex. 9 is a
series of CUC sentences that all began with a framing signal that
speciﬁed the conditions underlying arguments. Such intense use
of framing signals was not identiﬁed in any move of AUC.
Ex. 7. I examine the basic syntax of English comparatives and
readers’ expectations for.... (AUC).

Ex. 9. In terms of mode, we have. . .; in terms of motive, we

FIGURE 2 | Functional distribution of move-speciﬁc bundles in several communicative purposes (an inner circle: CUC; an outer circle: AUC; (A) introducing previous
studies; (B) presenting purposes of research; (C) displaying research acts; (D) reporting results of research; (E) demonstrating beneﬁciaries of research; and (F)
stating contents of chapters).
Figure 2D reveals both groups’ marked reliance on inferential
signals to signal the report of research results. It shows that
100% of the AUC move-speciﬁc bundles were inferential signals,
which were 77.78% of the CUC items. In addition to objective
signals, the CUC items included structuring and causative signals
that could be a speciﬁc discourse signal used by the Chinese
students for the purpose. The LL values of the CUC structuring
signal are as follows, and causative signals the major ﬁndings
were 34.05 and 17.73, respectively, but that of the inferential
signal we ﬁnd that was 13.32. The Chinese students speciﬁcally
used the combination of the major ﬁndings and are as follows
to signal the report of research results (Ex. 10). In comparison,
the American students commonly used inferential signals in
the pattern I + argue/show/propose/demonstrate/suggest that,
which could highlight writers’ individual contributions more
explicitly (Ex. 11).
Ex. 10. The major ﬁndings of the present research are as
follows: 1. . .2. . .3. . . (CUC RESULTS).
Ex. 11. I show that these two constructions again mirror the
situation. . .: I propose that the two constructions contribute the
same semantic pieces. . . (AUC RESULTS).
Regarding Conclusion, Figure 2E reveals that, despite the two
groups’ similar use of description bundles (e.g., the study of )
to point out the beneﬁciaries of their research, they generally
used diﬀerent categories as well as proportions of move-speciﬁc
bundles for the purpose. It shows that 26.32% of the CUC
items were topic bundles (e.g., second language acquisition)
that speciﬁed the beneﬁciary ﬁeld, which was not identiﬁed
in AUC. The American students speciﬁcally used engagement
feature bundles (e.g., our understanding of ) to build relevance
between readers and their research outcomes (Ex. 12). Using
participant-oriented bundles for the purpose as well, the Chinese
students used the stance feature bundle better understanding
of that also fell into noun phrase + of structure (Ex. 13). To
mark the discussion of implications, the Chinese students used
a combination of causative signals, structuring signals (Ex. 14),
and procedure bundles, diﬀerent from the American students’
sole use of causative signals (Ex. 15).

Topic bundles accounted for 26.67% of the CUC items but none
of the AUC items, which indicates the Chinese students’ more
recurrent mention of research subjects.
DISCUSSION
Proﬁles of BUDs in the Two Corpora
This study revealed that the Chinese students produced
signiﬁcantly more LBs than American students, consistent with
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

## Page 10

Bao and Liu
Lexical Bundles in Dissertation Abstracts
the ﬁnding in several previous studies that a considerably greater
number of English LBs were used by L1 Chinese than L1 English
writers (Guan and Zheng, 2005; Hyland, 2008a; Pang, 2009; Lou,
2010; Wei and Lei, 2011; Xu, 2012; Pan et al., 2016; Gao, 2017;
Lyu and Gee, 2020). A similar ﬁnding is achieved with L1 Spanish
speakers (Pérez-Llantada, 2014), L1 Iranian speakers (Jalali et al.,
2008), and L1 Turkish speakers (Güngör and Uysal, 2016).
These ﬁndings generally indicate L2 English writers’ greater
reliance on formulaic language to construct academic articles,
as discussed in Hyland (2008a) and Paquot and Granger (2012).
Hyland (2008a) argued that the considerably higher LB token
frequency in L2 writers’ academic writing primarily resulted from
apprentice writers’ heavier reliance on prefabricated items in the
development of their arguments. Likewise, Paquot and Granger
(2012, p. 139) argued that “less-proﬁcient learners seem to be
more reliant on lexical bundles.” This is largely because L1 writers
normally have a larger repertoire of formulaic language and thus
do not have to stick to a smaller variety of high-frequency items,
while L2 writers often have a smaller repertoire and have to use
high-frequency LBs more recurrently.
In addition, the diﬀerence could be partially explained by
the generic features of our corpora. Dissertation abstracts are
a high-stake genre, concerning both research manifestation and
degree fulﬁllment. While research manifestation is mainly for
international readers, degree fulﬁllment needs to be approved
by a dissertation supervision committee whose members are
primarily Chinese professors. To cope with the complicated
and important writing task in L2, Chinese students may tend
to use language sequences with which they feel conﬁdent and
specify situations of arguments more carefully, especially in a
considerably longer text.
The present study also found that, although the LBs frequently
used by the two groups were substantially diﬀerent with respect to
forms and frequencies, about 90% of the BUDs had occurrences
in both collections. In addition, BUDs distributed inequivalently
across functional categories and rhetorical moves. This ﬁnding
was new since most existing LB studies focus mainly on
frequently used LBs (e.g., Hyland, 2008a; Lu and Deng, 2019;
Lyu and Gee, 2020), but rarely on LBs of signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
frequencies across corpora. By focusing on BUDs, this study
revealed that the Chinese and American students drew on
a highly similar resource of formulaic sequences but selected
items with considerably diﬀerent frequencies. Nevertheless, these
ﬁndings need to be conﬁrmed in more similar research.
Patterns of BUDs in the Two Corpora
This study showed that the Chinese and American students ﬁlled
in diﬀerent constituents into the structurally and functionally
similar constructions, indicating the two groups’ diﬀerent choices
of lexical bundles.
Within inferential signals of subject + verb phrase + (that-
clause) structure, the Chinese students primarily used we ﬁnd
that and strictly avoided using LBs containing the ﬁrst person
singular I to reduce authorial stance, but these bundles were
the most common inferential signals used by the American
students. The ﬁrst person plural refers to the research work
or the author in CUC, which ought to be singular because
dissertations are individual works. The Chinese students’ use
of we probably resulted from their avoidance of authorial I
or a “misunderstanding of rhetorical conventions” (Li et al.,
2018, p. 42). Scholars in support of the avoidance of personal
pronouns in academic prose argue that an unrestrained use of
authorial I reduces the objective expression of ideas (Arnaudet
and Barrett, 1984; Kirsch, 1994; Spencer and Arbon, 1996). The
ﬁrst person viewpoint, however, has become more acceptable
in academia over recent years. Ivanic (1998) argued that the
ﬁrst person singular in academic writing is a powerful tool for
self-representation and the construction of authorial identity.
Similarly, Kuo (1999) and Hyland (2001) argued that a proper
use of authorial I could promote the emphasis on the authors’
individual contribution to a research ﬁeld. Notably, Section 4.16
of the newest APA style (American Psychological Association,
2020) as well as Section 5.40 of the newest Chicago Manual of
Style (The University of Chicago Press Editorial Staﬀ, 2017) both
encourage the use of ﬁrst person pronouns to describe research
work and personal reactions.
The study also revealed that the I-bundles were the most
important AUC bundle group in terms of token frequency but
were strictly avoided in CUC. The Chinese students’ avoidance
of using I might result from the conventional EAP protocol
that requires writers to conceal the authorial aspects in favor
of readers’ closer focus on the substance of writing (Arnaudet
and Barrett, 1984; Kirsch, 1994; Spencer and Arbon, 1996).
Since dissertations might be the most important piece of
writing in PhD students’ lives (Hyland, 2008a), Chinese students
are advised to use these bundles by substituting authorial I
with names of research, chapters, or sections, such as this
dissertation/study/chapter/section argues that for I argue that. The
sequence is able to help Chinese students promote an authorial
voice without breaking the protocol.
This study also showed that the Chinese and American
students used LBs of dissimilar functions to fulﬁll the same
communicative purposes. This might be related to the generic
features of CUC. For instance, the causative signal the major
ﬁndings and the structuring signal are as follows can be more
eﬀective discourse markers than inferential signals, such as I
show that to signal a considerably longer report of results, as
discussed in Allen (2009) and Qin (2014). The more frequent use
of objective signals like study aims to in presenting research aims
can be a more familiar discourse signal for Chinese professors,
especially in a substantially longer text, so are structuring signals
like the present study that marks implications in Conclusion, as
discussed in Cortes (2004).
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
This study examined three-word LBs in 1,400 dissertation
abstracts written by Chinese and American PhD students of
linguistics and focused on BUDs, which were LBs used with
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent frequencies by the two groups. The study
had two major ﬁndings. First, most BUDs had occurrences
in both corpora. The BUDs distributed inequivalently across
functional categories and rhetorical moves, with the text-oriented

category and move of Result having the most BUDs. Second,
the two groups used similar structures to construct LBs of the
same functions but ﬁlled diﬀerent constituents into structurally
and functionally similar constructions. They also used dissimilar
functions for the same communicative purposes in rhetorical
moves. Many BUDs related to the considerably lengthier texts in
CUC than in AUC. It should be noted that the Chinese students
strictly avoided ﬁlling ﬁrst person singular I in subject + verb
phrase + (that-clause) structure to reduce authorial stance, while
these bundles were the most common inferential signals used by
the American students to report results of their research.
These ﬁndings reveal not only general proﬁles of BUDs
in dissertation abstracts produced by Chinese and American
PhD students of linguistics but also how they used BUDs to
fulﬁll the same functions and communicative purposes. The
general proﬁles indicate a similar lexical resource from which
the Chinese and American students picked items with substantial
diﬀerent frequencies, categories, and moves of greater number
of BUDs and thus greater variations. Hence, the bundle lists
generated by this study can be used in teaching. An instructor
can also use lexical analysis tools to identify bundles used
diﬀerently by Chinese students compared with their American
counterparts, and then formulate a bundle list. The instructor
can then focus on reducing certain items and choosing a variety
of appropriate items within a certain functional category or
rhetorical move from her or his students’ writing in order
to enhance genre-nativeness. For instance, an instructor can
ask his/her students to use more (over) the course of instead
of (in) the process of to denote a time period, the extent
to which to replace the degree of, and speciﬁcally to replace
that is the in the same context. This can help reduce both
CUC and AUC BUDs whose frequencies oﬀset each other.
Meanwhile, because of the availability of various corpora,
students are encouraged to discover patterns of and diﬀerences
in the use of LBs by diﬀerent learner groups to improve
their own writing.
Additionally, our ﬁnding of speciﬁc patterns underlying
diﬀerent uses of LBs shows that not all BUDs ought to be
speciﬁcally noticed. The BUDs that relate to generic features
(e.g., of in the following vs. I show that, the former marked
a considerably lengthier move of Result in CUC), such as
substantially diﬀerent word counts and potentially diﬀerent
discoursal expectations toward the genre, should not be the
focus of instruction. Instead, the BUDs that relate to diﬀerent
linguistic choices in the same structure, function, as well as
context should be paid closer attention to (e.g., both the process
of vs. the course of denote a period of time). Instructors are
also advised to teach the AUC BUDs containing authorial I
to Chinese students by asking them to replace I with the
name of study, chapter, or section (e.g., I argue that taught as
this dissertation argues that). The revised sequence emphasizes
individual contributions and, at the same time, adapts to the
traditional EAP convention that discourages using authorial I.
The instructor can also measure learning progress by using
lexical analysis tools to compare LBs in L2 learners’ writing
against those produced by native learners of English. As
discussed in Kazemi et al. (2014), bundle-based instruction raises
learners’ awareness of formulaic language and develops their
English writing skills.
This study conﬁrms the need for using corpus linguistics
to identify and teach core genre-speciﬁc vocabularies to L2
learners. Even so, the research has certain limitations. The biggest
limitation is that it does not analyze the multifunctionality of LBs
because of the subjective nature of functional categorization and
the complexity of contexts. A study in a speciﬁc context may grant
us a closer understanding of LB functions. Secondly, the study
was based on corpora of texts with diﬀerent average lengths that
might aﬀect the use of LBs (Pan et al., 2020). Future studies can
use corpora of texts with a similar average length to complement
our investigation. Thirdly, the present research only investigated
dissertation abstracts produced by Chinese and American PhD
students of linguistics. A comparative study between diﬀerent
disciplines will enrich the literature on dissertation abstracts.
Such studies can help compile core genre-speciﬁc bundle lists that
include structural, functional, and rhetorical move distributions
to support instruction and research on EAP vocabularies. In
addition, future studies can apply psycholinguistic experiments to
determine the eﬀects of and causes for BUDs. L1 and L2 English
writers’ reactions to BUDs can help instructors develop tailored
teaching resources, techniques, and strategies.
