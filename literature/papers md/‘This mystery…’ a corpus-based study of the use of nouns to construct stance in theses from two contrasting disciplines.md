Abstract
This study investigates the construction of stance through nouns in two corpora of theses,
200,000 words in politics/international relations and 300,000 words in materials science. It
examines nouns which are preceded by sentence initial deictic This and which serve to encap-
sulate earlier propositions. Such forms are called ‘retrospective labels’ by Francis G. (1994).
Labelling discourse: an aspect of nominal-group lexical cohesion. In M. Coulthard (Ed.),
Advances in written text analysis (pp. 83–101). London: Routledge, and can be exempliﬁed as
follows: ‘Despite its lack of physical basis, the Potts model. . . has been very successful. . . This
mystery. . .’. It is shown that through encapsulation, such nouns organise the text and indicate
to the reader how the information is to be understood. In so doing they enable the writer to
take a stance as a competent member of the discipline. Disciplinary diﬀerences are seen in the
choice of noun, with higher frequencies in the politics corpus of both metalinguistic nouns
(e.g. ‘argument’) and nouns that are inherently marked for stance (e.g. ‘confusion’). It is
argued that this variation is due to diﬀerences between the disciplines in research practices and
the construction of knowledge. I suggest that this use of nouns is important for thesis writers,
as it constitutes a valuable resource for the construction of convincing arguments and the
expression of appropriate stance.

1. Introduction
Stance has been deﬁned as the expression of the writer’s ‘personal feelings, atti-
tudes, value judgements, or assessments’ (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, &
Firegan, 1999: 966). Recently there has been wide-ranging research on this feature of
academic writing, for example comparing its use by expert and non-expert writers
(Barton, 1993), investigating markers of stance (Biber and Finegan, 1988, 1989;
Conrad and Biber, 2000) and proposing a taxonomy of stance features (Hyland,
1999). Other researchers have examined this aspect of academic writing under the
term ‘evaluation’. These include Hunston (1989, 1993, 1994) and Thetela (1997),
who analyse evaluation in academic research articles, Thompson and Ye (1991),
who study reporting verbs and Hoey (2000), who discusses Chomsky’s use of eva-
luative language.
The use of nouns to construct stance in academic writing has so far attracted little
attention, despite the fact that several researchers have identiﬁed a group of nouns
which oﬀer the possibility of incorporating interpersonal meanings in the text. These
nouns have two characteristic features: they require lexical realisation in their
immediate context and they create cohesion. Halliday and Hasan (1976: 274–284) ﬁrst
identiﬁed a class of ‘general nouns’, and showed that they allow the writer to intro-
duce ‘an interpersonal element into the meaning’ (276). Winter (1982: 185–186) dis-
tinguished a wider category of ‘unspeciﬁc nouns’, while Ivanic (1991) examined what she
called ‘carrier nouns’. Basing their ﬁndings on a large amount of corpus data, Hun-
ston and Francis (1999: 185–188) propose a possible new word class, ‘shell’ nouns.
Perhaps the most detailed investigation of such nouns can be found in Francis
(1986, 1994). In her 1994 paper, Francis uses the term ‘label’ for ‘inherently unspeciﬁc
nominal elements’ that require lexical realisation in the co-text (Francis, 1994: 83).
She examines the role of these labels in expository texts written with a persuasive
purpose and characterises them as ‘primarily interactive organisational signals’ (Fran-
cis, 1986: 3). Nominal groups that refer to forthcoming propositions are termed
‘advance labels’ and those that refer to earlier propositions, ‘retrospective labels’
(Francis 1994: 83). The latter ‘encapsulate’ the whole of a previous proposition
(Sinclair 1981, 1992, 1993), so that its meaning is present in the following sentence.
This paper will focus speciﬁcally on the use of retrospective labels in the con-
struction of stance, as illustrated in (1) below. This shortcoming is lexicalised in the
previous sentence and serves as a cohesive device; at the same time it clearly
expresses the attitude of the writer towards the Guidelines.
(1) . . .the Guidelines fall short of recognising that women as such constitute a
particular social group. This shortcoming leads to problems. . . (mpokuch2). . .1
Such nominalisations are examples of grammatical metaphor in Halliday’s terms
(1994: 342) and their use facilitates the construction of the argument.

2. Data and method
The present study employs a corpus-based approach to investigate the way in which
retrospective labels are used to construct stance. The data is drawn from two corpora
of theses written by native speakers of English at the University of Oxford. The politics
corpus consists of eight MPhil theses (approximately 200,000 words) in politics and
international relations, while the materials corpus is composed of eight doctoral theses
(about 300,000 words) in materials science. A social science and a natural science were
chosen in order to enable comparison between disciplines. Since the purpose here is to
compare post-graduate native-speaker writing in the two disciplines, it is not thought
likely that the diﬀerence in degree level will aﬀect the results of the study unduly. The
theses were obtained from the authors on disk and the corpora were examined using
concordance software from WordSmith Tools (Scott, 1996).
According to Francis (1994: 89), retrospective labels are much more frequent than
advance labels and the head nouns ‘are almost always preceded by a speciﬁc deictic
like the, this, that or such’ (Francis, 1994: 85). Thus in order to facilitate the identiﬁ-
cation of labels and to ensure suﬃcient, while not overwhelming, numbers of instan-
ces, I restricted the investigation to retrospective labels that occur with the deictic This
in sentence initial position. An example from the materials corpus is given below.
(2) Despite its a [sic] lack of physical basis, the Potts model (e=0) has been very
successful in simulating the kinetics and topology of normal grain growth
(Anderson et al., 1989b). This mystery is what makes the model so fas-
cinating. . . (dmamich5)
All instances of sentence initial This+noun were retrieved from both corpora and
examined in context to determine whether they were functioning as retrospective
labels or not. Identiﬁcation of labels was not always straightforward, however. First,
it was often necessary to examine a large amount of context before analysis could be
made. In the example below This technique simply refers back to a heading given ﬁve
pages earlier: Electrostatic Spraying and thus is not a label.
(3) This technique has proved its usefulness in fabricating cadmium sulphide,
lead sulphide and gallium arsenide QD. . . (dmahuch4)
Second, as labels refer to and make use of the shared knowledge of reader and
writer, it was not always possible for a non-specialist to be certain whether a given
stretch of text provided a lexicalisation or not. For these two reasons the emphasis
here will be on qualitative rather than quantitative statements. Although an attempt
will be made below to quantify the extent of this type of labelling, it should be noted
that such ﬁgures are only approximate.
Table 1 gives the frequency information on retrospective labels using sentence
initial This+noun in the two corpora. In Politics2 there are 146 tokens, 76.8 per
2 Use of capitalisation (i.e. Politics, Materials) denotes reference to the corpus.

100,000 words, while in Materials there are 180 tokens, 60.0 occurrences per 100,000
words. Thus the overall occurrence of these labels is somewhat higher in the politics
than the materials corpus. Comparison of the head noun types3 shows 108 in Poli-
tics, giving a ﬁgure of 56.8 per 100,000 words, and 99 in Materials, resulting in only
33.0 per 100,000 words. Thus there is a much wider range of head nouns in the
politics than in the materials corpus. There is very little diﬀerence between the two
corpora in the ﬁgures for tokens per type: 1.4 for Politics as against 1.8 for Materi-
als. In both corpora the large majority of nouns occur only once.
3. Metalinguistic and non-metalinguistic head nouns of labels
Francis (1994: 89) distinguishes a category of head nouns of labels which she calls
‘metalinguistic’. These ‘label a stretch of discourse as being of a particular type of
language. They are used by the writer to forge relationships which are located
entirely within the discourse itself; they instruct the reader to interpret the linguistic
status of a proposition in a particular way’. Examples of metalinguistic nouns which
occur in the data are: point, distinction, expression; non-metalinguistic nouns include:
eﬀect, result, observation.
Following Francis’s deﬁnition, Table 2 shows ﬁgures for metalinguistic and non-
metalinguistic head nouns in the two corpora.

It is noticeable that, while the normed ﬁgures for non-metalinguistic head nouns
are roughly similar in the two corpora, Politics uses twice as many metalinguistic head
nouns as Materials. We may account for this by referring to disciplinary diﬀerences in
the construction of knowledge. First, politics research mostly draws upon resources
that are language based: both written and spoken records. It is also primarily concerned
with constructing accounts and interpretations of events that are predominantly in
written form. Thus the activity of the discipline is inherently text-based. This leads
to a higher frequency of metalinguistic nouns. An example is given below.
(4) The following passages are recorded in the Sub-Committee’s Report: [quo-
tation omitted] This discussion between state representatives at the UNHCR
illustrates the signiﬁcant issues in the debate over gender-related persecution.
(mpokuch2)
By contrast, although texts are, of course, produced in materials science, the
activity of the discipline is primarily directed to the performance of experiments. As
a result we ﬁnd fewer metalinguistic nouns in Materials and occurrences of nouns
referring to material processes are frequent. This is shown in the following example.
(5) Specimens were cut, ground and polished, as for the optical examination.
This procedure was followed in the ﬁrst instance by electro-polishing (see
Table 6.2). (dmamich6)
Second, as Becher (1989: 13) points out, in social sciences there is a ‘pre-
dominantly recursive or reiterative pattern of development’. Knowledge is advanced
by putting forward the views of others in order to take up a position in relation to
them. This tendency is reﬂected in the more frequent use of metalinguistic nouns by
writers in Politics. An example appears below.
(6) Particular concern is expressed regarding the ﬁeld of R&D, because of the
dominance of military expenditure in this area and the scarcity of qualiﬁed
people. This point is made by Glyn and Harrison. . . (mpowbch)
The growth of knowledge in the natural sciences, however, tends to proceed
cumulatively, with one person’s work building on that of another (Becher, 1989: 13).
To the extent that the work of others is turned into ‘fact’, or ‘black-boxed’ in Latour
and Woolgar’s (1986) terms, there is less need for the materials science writer to take
a stance towards it. Thus we ﬁnd fewer instances of metalinguistic nouns in the
Materials data.
4. The construction of stance through the use of a retrospective label
Francis notes that a retrospective label ‘is presented as equivalent to the clause or
clauses it replaces’ (Francis, 1994: 85 original emphasis) and stresses that ‘such

317


## Page 6

synonymity is a construct’ (Francis, 1994: 93). Given that all labels are constructions
of the writer, it follows that their discourse-organising function will reﬂect the pur-
poses and views of the writer and hence indicate the writer’s stance. As Hoey points
out, ‘When a relation is signalled, a message is communicated about the way in
which the discourse should be interpreted’ (Hoey, 1983: 178). To the extent that the
label signals a relation of equivalence, it also indicates the way in which the text
should be interpreted.
The use of a retrospective label involves two important choices made by the wri-
ter: ﬁrst, which information to encapsulate and second, the way in which it is label-
led. These choices reﬂect the writer’s perceptions, either of real world events or
actions (using non-metalinguistic head nouns) or of the text itself (using meta-
linguistic head nouns). By choosing which information to label, writers organise the
text and by choosing the label itself, they incorporate their meaning therein. In my
data these choices reﬂect perceptions that are based upon the forms of knowledge
and enquiry that characterise the relevant discipline. I will illustrate this with an
example from Materials of a label with a non-metalinguistic head noun.
(7) As the applied ﬁeld moves beyond its maximum and starts to fall the
screening currents within the sample respond, reversing their direction and
changing the nature of the ﬁeld proﬁle within the sample, (b). This process
continues as the ﬁeld drops further until the state shown in (c). (dmahoch8)
The label This process encapsulates the whole of the previous sentence, showing
the writer’s perception of the series of real world events described. By labelling all
these events together, the writer shows that he perceives them as a single entity and
by choosing the head noun process, he indicates the speciﬁc way in which these
events are linked. Indeed it is interesting to note that the same eﬀect would not be
achieved by connecting the two sentences with the deictic This alone. The writer’s
perceptions, however, are based upon discipline speciﬁc knowledge and it is this that
enables him to see the events as forming a meaningful whole which is greater than
the sum of its parts. A non-specialist describing the same phenomena might not
regard the events as connected or might come up with a diﬀerent label; for example,
they could be called a ‘sequence’ or a ‘chain of events’. Thus the use of retrospective
labels shows the writer taking a stance as a member of a given disciplinary commu-
nity. Both the fact of using a label and the chosen label itself reﬂect the disciplinary
knowledge that the writer brings to bear upon the content with which he deals.
Moreover, as noted above, these labels are interactive: their use aﬀects the reader’s
perception of the proposition(s) put forward and so enables the reader to perceive
the organisation and meaning that the writer intends. Indeed the successful proces-
sing of the text depends upon the reader accepting, at least provisionally, the labels
assigned. The next example from Politics uses a metalinguistic head noun.
(8) Policies aimed at raising the stakes faced by a state. . . are likely to produce
convergence in these competition-related areas of state practice. . . This claim is
made on the basis of the conceptual analysis oﬀered here. (mpoalch2)

As readers, we are expected ﬁrst to perceive the relationship of equivalence that the
writer sets up between the proposition in the ﬁrst sentence and the nominal group This
claim and second to accept that this label provides a more or less acceptable designa-
tion for that proposition. Again, however, it is the writer’s view that we are oﬀered;
alternative labels such as ‘This point’ or ‘This interpretation’ could have been used.
Nevertheless, in order to proceed with the text, it is necessary for the reader to suspend
any possible objections and process the label as chosen by the writer.
When we focus speciﬁcally on their organisational role, we can see that these
labels also mark the writer’s stance. It is the writer who chooses the organisation of
the text and the stance is revealed in the relationship that the writer constructs
between encapsulated proposition and label. In the following example from Mate-
rials, the writer establishes that the information in the ﬁrst sentence can be regarded
as a theory. Through encapsulation, the label makes the preceding information
available for extension with further details, which are then given in the rest of the
sentence and ultimately contribute to the construction of the writer’s argument. In
this way the label functions as a discourse organiser, while at the same time expres-
sing the writer’s stance towards the proposition it encapsulates.
(9) A consensus is forming around the idea of ‘vortex pancakes’ (Clem, 1991) in
the highly layered Bi-2212, Bi-2223 and probably in the thallium based materi-
als as well. This theory uses evidence that many of these materials are not in fact
superconductors outside the CuO planes themselves... (dmahoch2)
A further function of retrospective labels, in particular those with metalinguistic
head nouns, is that they assign to their replacement clauses ‘a particular status in the
argument’ (Francis, 1994: 84). This also contributes to the marking of stance, as
illustrated in the example from Politics below.
(10) There may be strong ideological imperatives for adding a ‘gender’
ground. . . This position does not necessarily hold that women exist exclusively
in the private sphere and that the refugee deﬁnition only protects against per-
secution in the public sphere. Rather, it holds that. . . (mpokuch1)
Here the necessity of adding a ‘gender’ ground is assigned the status of a position held
by some of those involved in the ongoing debate concerning women’s refugee claims.
The label carries out an organisational function in that the writer can now use it as
part of an examination of diﬀerent positions on the issue. At the same time the label
conveys the writer’s view that the preceding information is indeed a position, rather
than, for example, an ‘idea’, so it carries out a stance function as well. Crucially, by
choosing the noun position, a writer gains the ability to attack or defend the proposi-
tion given. This in turn allows readers to predict the likely course of the text and
ultimately leads them to expect a statement of the writer’s own position.
So far, then, we have seen how nouns used as retrospective labels construct stance
through their discourse organising function. Next we will examine how stance can
also be expressed through the choice of head noun.

5. The construction of stance within the head noun of a label
Certain labels incorporate stance within the head noun itself. Here I identify these
nouns using two types of stance distinguished by Biber et al. (1999): epistemic and
attitudinal. Epistemic stance ‘comments on the status of information in a proposi-
tion’ (Biber et al., 1999: 972), marking, for example, certainty, doubt, actuality or
precision, while attitudinal stance markers ‘report personal attitudes or feelings’
(Biber et al., 1999: 974). It should be noted that, although modiﬁcation oﬀers a
further opportunity for the incorporation of stance, lack of space does not permit its
discussion here. Accordingly the ﬁgures for epistemic and attitudinal stance given in
Table 3 refer only to unmodiﬁed head nouns.
Comparing the normed ﬁgures, Politics uses about twice as many of these stance
nouns as Materials, with double the number of epistemic nouns and roughly three
times as many attitudinally marked nouns. In both corpora, nouns which express
epistemic stance (e.g. claim, theory, assumption) are more frequent than those which
express attitudinal stance (e.g. problem, limitation, atrocity).
In Materials it is noticeable that many of the metalinguistic head nouns that
express epistemic stance introduce clauses in which the encapsulated information is
shown to contribute in a positive way to the construction of the writer’s argument.
An example is given below, where the information that constitutes the hypothesis
provides an explanation for one of the writer’s ﬁndings and thus enables him to use
it in building his argument.
(11) Also, the Schmid factor for slip on the cube plane must not be inﬁnitesi-
mal. This hypothesis explains why inverse creep occurs in Ni3Al specimens
oriented. . . (dmaluch2)
We may explain this phenomenon by referring again to the cumulative construc-
tion of knowledge. In materials science positive evaluation tends to be important,
since work that can be evaluated in a positive light can most usefully form the basis
of future research. Thus the nouns are often used in showing how theory and
experimental ﬁndings support each other to construct a persuasive argument. Further
examples that occur in the data include the following:
(12) This ﬁnding is of use if very long-term tests are performed. . . (dmabuch7)

(13) This explanation is in agreement with the experimental observations.
(dmasech7)
(14) This theory is supported by the wider scratch track observed in this coating.
(dmacoch8)
In most of the Politics examples, however, the content of the clause following the
label is not a positive evaluation; it merely supplies the next step of the argument.
(15) This view stems from their lack of belief in the ability of the market econ-
omy to reallocate resources. . . (mpowbch4)
(16) This proposition could be tested through a comparative analysis of. . .
(mpoalch4)
(17) This assumption applied to other middle powers by extension. (mpobach2)
In both corpora the frequency of attitudinal stance nouns is rather low. In Poli-
tics, about three-quarters of attitudinally marked nouns evaluate negatively and the
majority of these express a stance towards political situations or events. An example
is given below.
(18) Only when acting in self-defence could UN troops employ force. This limit-
ation was added to the resolution at the insistence of France and the United
Kingdom. . . (mpomqch3)
Other nouns used in this way include: atrocity, dilemma, disjointedness and
restriction, along with the one noun that evaluates positively: improvement. There
are only two examples, both negative, which evaluate the work of other researchers:
confusion and failure. An example is given below.
(19) The various attempts to connect the behaviour of middle powers to their
capabilities have failed. . . This failure means that the term is not much more
than a self-description. (mpobach2)
The ﬁgures for attitudinal nouns are lower in Materials. There are four examples
of nouns that mark a negative stance towards the phenomena described: problem (2
examples), limitation and ambiguity. An example is given below.
(20) The predominance of <110> screw dislocations over edge ones is because. . .
Conversely, it could also mean that. . . This ambiguity must be considered when
using TEM to elucidate the processes responsible for slip during creep. (dmaluch5)
However there are also three nouns which evaluate positively: solution, correction
and progress. Of these solution and correction refer to the writer’s own work, as
shown in example (21).

(21) It is now thought the problem could be eliminated by controlling the rela-
tionship between the applied ﬁeld direction and the direction of the transport
current. . . This solution has not been tried in practice at this stage. . . (dmahoch6)
Progress, however, relates more generally to work within the discipline, as seen
below.
(22) The introduction of improved growth methods for Group III-V material. . .
has enabled the reduction in device dimensions. This progress has demanded a
corresponding improvement in characterisation techniques. (dmasech1)
Where evaluation of research is concerned, it could again be that the occurrence of
positive evaluation in Materials is related to the cumulative construction of knowl-
edge in this discipline, while the negative evaluation in Politics is connected to
recursive knowledge-building in the discipline of politics. However further research
with much larger corpora would be necessary in order to verify this suggestion; the
number of instances is too low here for valid generalisations to be made.
Stance is evident, then, in the choice of inherently evaluative head nouns of labels,
with Politics showing more extensive marking than Materials. However in both
corpora attitudinal stance nouns are used only sparingly to evaluate the research of
others.
6. The incorporation of stance as given information
Although head nouns of retrospective labels are always presented as given infor-
mation (Francis 1994: 86), Francis points out that the writer’s evaluation of the
proposition may actually be new information. In such cases the incorporation of
writer stance in the given element of the clause may make the evaluation more dif-
ﬁcult to detect and therefore less likely to be challenged by the reader. In my data,
however, where evaluation occurs in the head noun, it is usually already apparent in
the preceding proposition itself, particularly in the case of attitudinal stance. In these
cases the label contributes to a double signalling of the writer’s stance.
In the example below from Politics, the label is used in the middle of a passage
that is highly critical of another writer’s work. I have not quoted it all, but the ﬁrst
sentence gives an indication of the argument so far. This is then supported by the
examples in the second and third sentences and culminates in the ﬁnal sentence with
the use of the noun confusion.
(23) The lines of causation thus become diﬃcult to untangle. Socialization, or
normative co-option, leads to policy alignment in the ﬁrst mechanism, but is the
result of policy coercion in the second. The socialization of individuals is trea-
ted as the independent variable at times, the dependent variable at others. This
confusion results from the attempt to deﬁne state socialization as change to the
cognitive and normative framework of governing elites. (mpoalch1)

## Page 11

Here, although the noun confusion is evaluative, the information it contains is not
new, but is easily predictable from the preceding context. Thus the label lends
emphasis to the evaluation already given. This can be seen even more clearly when the
head noun repeats the lexis of the encapsulated information, as in the next example.
(24) The various attempts to connect the behaviour of middle powers to their
capabilities have failed because no matter how we hold power constant, their
behaviour still varies. This failure means that the term is not much more than a
self-description. (mpobach2)
Where epistemic stance is concerned, the position is less clear, partly because of
the diﬃculty in interpreting a specialist text. In example (24) from Materials,
experimental observations are labelled as evidence. Although this is new informa-
tion, it is likely that the specialist reader would, in fact, regard the observations as
constituting evidence.
(25) Furthermore, the dislocations do not appear as dissociated partials when
they are strongly visible in (a)/(b) (g=220 ), (c) (g=220) and (e) (g=020 ). This
evidence suggests that. . . (dmaluch4)
In the next example it is more likely that the use of claim does incorporate a new
evaluation in the given element. Here the writer’s intention may be to distance him-
self somewhat from the reported ﬁndings, since they raise doubts as to the validity of
the modelling procedure used, as shown in the last sentence of the extract.
(26) Li et al. (1994) has simulated 3D abnormal growth. . . They report that at
low volume fractions abnormal grains are able to sweep through particles to
consume the matrix. This claim raises an important issue regarding the Monte
Carlo modelling of grain growth in the presence of particles; namely that at low
volume fractions the pinned grain size approaches the dimensions of the model.
Under these circumstances we must question the validity of the conclusions
deduced from such a model. (dmamich2)
However for a thesis writer as candidate professional, it may be considered
appropriate to use an unobtrusive position for the ﬁrst indication of negative stance,
since criticism of the work of others can constitute a face-threatening activity
(Myers, 1989). We should also note that the subsequent text provides the basis for
the evaluation, signalled by namely. Thus the purpose of the label seems to be to give
an early signal of the writer’s stance, rather than to incorporate evaluation in a
position where it is unlikely to be questioned.
When evaluation is incorporated in the head noun, then, it often forms part of a
more extensive construction of stance. In such cases the evaluation actually is given
information and the label functions to emphasise rather than to hide the stance
already taken. This facilitates reader scrutiny, enabling a challenge to be put for-
ward if necessary.

7. Conclusion
This paper has examined the use of nouns in retrospective labels and shown that
they contribute signiﬁcantly to the construction of stance in both disciplines exam-
ined. Through the encapsulation of preceding propositions the nouns structure the
text and indicate to the reader how the information is to be understood. In so doing
they enable the writer to take a stance as a knowledgeable member of the ﬁeld.
Disciplinary variation is also found, particularly in the noun chosen: higher fre-
quencies of both metalinguistic nouns and nouns that are inherently marked for
stance occur in the politics than in the materials corpus. I argue that diﬀerences
between the two disciplines in research practices and the construction of knowledge
lie at the root of the variation observed.
I suggest that the ability to handle nouns used as retrospective labels is important
for thesis writers. There are two main reasons for this. First, the successful encap-
sulation of information leads to an argument which is clearly structured and thus
more likely to be convincing. Second, the choice of a head noun for the label is a
resource which writers can use to construct an appropriate stance by presenting
themselves as competent professionals in the discipline.
As Johns and Swales (2002: 13) point out, uncertainty over ‘what role there might
be for a personal voice’ is one area of diﬃculty that aﬀects student writing at all
levels, including the thesis. They illustrate this point by referring to the use of per-
sonal pronouns such as ‘I’ or ‘we’. However I would suggest that the creation of an
appropriate authorial voice or stance is a much more pervasive phenomenon, which
is realised through a wide range of linguistic resources, including the nouns exam-
ined here. The materials science student who writes in his thesis ‘This mystery is
what makes the model so fascinating. . .’ has found a way of expressing his personal
voice through his use of not only the noun mystery, but also the adjective fascinat-
ing, the adverb so and the cleft construction.
It is clear from this example that much work remains to be done to shed further
light on the role of personal voice or stance and the means by which it is realised.
However it is hoped that the ﬁndings of this study on nouns will contribute to the
clariﬁcation of this area of uncertainty for all those involved in the writing of theses.
