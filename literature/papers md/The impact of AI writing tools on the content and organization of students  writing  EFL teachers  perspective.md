Abstract:  The primary objective of this study was to examine the range of available 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) writing tools and assess their influence on student writing, 
particularly in terms of content and organization, as perceived by English as a Foreign 
Language (EFL) teachers. Utilizing a qualitative approach, the research was con­
structed within a case study design. The data was collected via semi-structured inter­
views, targeting information about the diversity of AI writing tools and their impact on 
students” writing quality. The study gathered data from four EFL teachers across three 
distinct universities in Indonesia, shedding light on the variety of AI writing tools used 
in their classrooms. These included applications like Quillbot, WordTune, Jenni, Chat- 
GPT, Paperpal, Copy.ai, and Essay Writer. Furthermore, these teachers unanimously 
agreed that the AI writing tools positively improved their students’ writing quality, 
particularly enhancing the quality of their content and organization. The findings of this 
study imply that integrating AI writing tools can prove beneficial in elevating the 
quality of EFL student writing. In response to this study’s limitations, recommendations 
for future research were also addressed.

1. Introduction
The use of Artificial Intelligent (AI)-powered writing tools in English as a foreign language (EFL) 
classroom is increasing rapidly. These tools include grammar checks, writing aids, and programs 
that can create written works like essays without human help. They are easy to use and effective, 
saving students and educators time and effort (T. S. Chang et al., 2021; Gayed et al., 2022; 
Jeanjaroonsri, 2023; Zhao, 2022). Additionally, AI writing tools have been used particularly for 
EFL learners with low English proficiency. By using these tools, students can receive immediate 
feedback and assistance, improving their writing skills faster.
In general, AI writing tools are intended to analyze written materials and provide comments on 
many parts of the writing, such as grammar, vocabulary, syntax, content, and structure (Hosseini 
et al., 2023; Strobl et al., 2019; Thorp, 2023). Such feedback is created by machine-learning 
algorithms that compare the written text to a big database of correct and incorrect instances of 
writing. In other words, EFL students can obtain instant and tailored feedback on their writing, 
which can assist them in identifying and correcting faults more rapidly. This real-time feedback can 
also assist students in comprehending the fundamental concepts of successful writing and offer 
them with direction for enhancing their writing abilities (Akgun & Greenhow, 2022; Nazari et al.,  
2021; Rudolph et al., 2023).
Recently, there is a growing amount of research on how AI writing tools affect student writing 
skills, and this research is relevant to the TEFL enterprise. Some research suggests that adopting 
AI-powered writing tools can help students improve their writing (e.g., Kurniati & Fithriani, 2022; 
Wang, 2022; Zhao, 2022), while others have voiced concerns about the side effect of these tools 
(e.g., Y. Liu et al., 2022; Lund & Wang, 2023; Qadir, 2022). Nevertheless, the literature presented 
focuses solely on the role of AI writing tools in improving grammar and syntax. While this is 
undeniably a crucial aspect, it does not address the full spectrum of what contributes to effective 
writing. The content and organization of a piece of writing are equally significant components that 
profoundly affect the reader’s understanding and engagement (I. Lee & Yuan, 2021). Content is 
the core of any piece of writing. It carries the ideas, thoughts, and messages that the writer wants 
to convey. It is the “what” of the writing—the substance. High-quality content is relevant, infor­
mative, original, and meaningful, resonating with the audience and fulfilling its purpose—whether 
that be to inform, persuade, entertain, or provoke thought (Molina et al., 2021). Organization, on 
the other hand, is the “how” of the writing—the structure. It involves how the content is arranged, 
connecting ideas in a logical, coherent manner that guides the reader through the piece. The 
organization can significantly affect how well the reader understands the content, how persua­
sively an argument is presented, or how engaging a narrative is. Good organization ensures 
a smooth flow of ideas, making the writing easier to follow and more impactful (Awada et al.,  
2020). Therefore, the focus on just grammar and syntax overlooks the critical roles of content and 
organization in writing. While getting the words right is essential, what those words express and 
how they are structured are just as vital to effective communication. Thus, it is crucial to explore 
what the types of AI writing tools and how the tools address these other key aspects of writing 
from the perspective of EFL educators.
A similar situation holds true in the Indonesian context. To the best of our knowledge, there is 
almost no research in the Indonesian context that has been reported in journal articles examining 
the impact of AI writing tools on the content and organization from either students’ or teachers’ 
perspective. The present authors are aware of the seminal work of Miranty and Widiati (2021) and 
Fahmi and Cahyono (2021), which, to some degree of details, examine the use of Automated

Writing Evaluation (AWE) as one of the AI writing tools employed by Indonesian EFL students in 
their writing. Miranty and Widiati (2021) explored students’ perceptions of the merits and draw­
backs of AWE (i.e., Grammarly), while Fahmi and Cahyono (2021) aimed to investigate differences 
in students’ perceptions towards the use of AWE based on their proficiency levels. Their research 
findings suggest that using AWE can provide students with positive benefits, which were consistent 
across their studies. Despite these insightful findings, more research on the impact of AI writing 
tools is necessary. It is true the previous studies have provided information regarding the influence 
of these tools on student writing. However, it is still unclear how AI writing tools affect the quality 
of student writing particularly on the aspects of content and organization. Consequently, this study 
has been meticulously designed to fill the prevailing knowledge gap, thereby delivering a more 
comprehensive understanding of AI writing tools’ utility in EFL classrooms. The primary objective of 
this research is to explore the variety of AI writing tools and evaluate their impact on student 
writing, particularly focusing on content and organization, through the lens of EFL teachers. To this 
end, we posed the following critical research questions:
(1) What types of AI writing tools are used by EFL teachers to improve students’ writing quality, 
particularly in terms of content and organization?
(2) How do EFL teachers perceive the impact of AI writing tools on the content and organization 
aspects of students’ writing?
The urgency in answering these research questions stems from two primary reasons. Firstly, 
understanding the types of AI writing tools used by teachers and their methods of integration 
could provide a blueprint for other educators looking to implement similar technologies in their 
teaching practices. This insight can ultimately contribute to the broader and more effective use of 
AI in EFL instruction. Secondly, investigating teachers’ perceptions of AI writing tools is crucial. If 
teachers view these tools as beneficial, this positive perception can lead to more widespread 
adoption, enriching EFL instruction across the board. However, if teachers are apprehensive or 
skeptical about these tools, identifying and addressing their concerns becomes paramount. This 
understanding would allow for modifications in AI tools or teaching strategies to ensure the 
potential of AI is fully realized and appreciated in language learning settings. By answering 
these questions, this study hopes to pave the way for more effective AI integration in EFL 
classrooms.
2. Literature review
2.1. Teaching writing in the artificial intelligence era
The evolution of teaching writing in the current age of technological proliferation cannot be dissociated 
from the rapid advancement of digital tools and. As eloquently discussed in Haleem’s et al. (2022) 
research, this shift is precipitated by an increasing fusion of digital utilities within the educational realm, 
effectively transforming traditional pen-and-paper methodologies into far more creative and dynamic 
pedagogical experiences. Garlinska et al. (2023) discuss how virtual classrooms, online workshops, and 
cloud-based writing tools, for example, are revolutionizing the domain of writing instruction. These 
platforms offer functionalities such as real-time feedback, collaborative editing, and plagiarism checks. 
Such features not only enhance the writing acumen of students, as per Nykyporets’s (2023) study, but 
also inspire them to engage in critical thinking and independent reasoning.
Furthermore, as illustrated by Bhutoria’s (2022) work, AI-driven platforms and applications offer 
personalized learning opportunities for students, identifying their writing strengths and weak­
nesses. This empowers educators to tailor their teaching strategies to each student’s unique 
needs and preferences, leading to more effective learning outcomes (Dogan et al., 2023). In the 
same vein, Cahyono et al. (2023) explored of the workable approach mediated by mobile technol­
ogy in teaching writing uncovers another layer of tech-enabled pedagogical innovation. Students 
are emboldened to publish their work in public forums, nurturing their confidence and writing 
Marzuki et al., Cogent Education (2023), 10: 2236469                                                                                                                                                     
https://doi.org/10.1080/2331186X.2023.2236469

abilities. Such platforms also promote peer review and feedback mechanisms, fostering a sense of 
community and collaborative learning (Umamah & Cahyono, 2022). However, as the literature 
acknowledges, the digitization of writing instruction is not without its challenges. As Duncan and 
Joyner (2022) articulated, educators must grapple with issues related to digital equity, privacy, and 
the potential for distraction. These issues underscore the necessity for an ongoing dialogue and 
proactive approaches in crafting pedagogical policies and strategies as we continue to navigate 
the teaching of writing in this artificial intelligence era.
2.2. The impact of AI writing tools on students writing quality
There has been burgeoning research on the impact of AI writing tools on students’ writing ability. 
While several studies indicate positive outcomes, others highlight potential negative impacts. On the 
positive side, AI writing tools such as Grammarly, QuillBot, Wordtune, and Jenni have been found to 
significantly improve students’ writing skills. These tools utilize advanced algorithms to identify 
common errors in grammar, punctuation, and syntax and provide suggestions to improve clarity 
and style. They also offer unique capabilities such as paraphrasing and refining sentences for 
enhanced effectiveness. A study by Tambunan et al. (2022) showed that using Grammarly improved 
students’ grammar and punctuation. Grammarly’s AI analyzes the user’s text, provides real-time 
suggestions for enhancing grammar, spelling, punctuation, clarity, engagement, and delivery. This 
has the effect of turning the process of writing into a learning opportunity. QuillBot, another AI tool, 
specializes in paraphrasing, helping students avoid plagiarism while maintaining the original meaning 
of their content. Kurniati and Fithriani (2021) found that QuillBot aided students in developing better 
paraphrasing skills, which is a critical competency in academic writing. WordTune, on the other hand, 
focuses on refining and improving the tone and style of the text. A study by Lam and Moorhouse (2022) 
found that WordTune effectively helped students identify their writing weaknesses, thereby promoting 
self-assessment and learning. This tool goes beyond simple grammar correction and delves into the 
stylistic elements of writing. Jenni is another AI-based writing assistant that provides predictive text 
suggestions to help users compose emails, reports, articles, and other documents more efficiently. 
Although no specific research was cited in this regard, user feedback suggests a positive impact on 
writing productivity and creativity. GPT-3, developed by OpenAI, represents a significant advancement 
in language model technology. Capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant sentences, 
GPT-3 has been found to stimulate students’ creative and critical thinking (Mhlanga, 2023). It can be an 
excellent tool for students to experiment with different writing styles and ideas. These studies high­
light the potential of AI tools in enhancing the writing abilities of students.
In terms of the content and the structure of writing, a number of research has shown that AI 
writing tools can significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of writing tasks. AI-based tools, 
like GPT-3 and its successor GPT-4, have been leveraged to suggest the next word or paragraph in 
a text, aiding authors in creating human-like compositions (Y. Liu et al., 2023). This process is 
facilitated by machine learning algorithms that predict text sequences based on the vast amount 
of data they have been trained on. Furthermore, there is ongoing research exploring the impact of 
these tools on different aspects of writing. For instance, a study found that AI writing tools like “AI 
KAKU”, a popular Japanese-developed English language learning tool, could potentially reduce 
cognitive barriers for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners when producing written text in 
English (Gayed et al., 2022). This is achieved by providing real-time translation and grammar 
suggestions, making the writing process less daunting. Another important application of AI in 
writing is its ability to expedite the literature review process, which deals with large volumes of 
partially structured (meta)data (Wagner et al., 2022). This is particularly valuable in fields like 
healthcare and social sciences, where researchers must often sift through enormous bodies of 
literature for their studies. In conclusion, the evolution and application of AI writing tools like have 
undoubtedly marked a significant stride in the world of writing and literature. These advancements 
hold substantial potential in not only streamlining the writing process but also in improving the 
quality and efficiency of written output.
Marzuki et al., Cogent Education (2023), 10: 2236469

Despite these advantages, certain studies have indicated potential drawbacks. For instance, AI 
writing tools may inadvertently promote over-reliance among students, as they might lean too 
heavily on these tools for correction without thoroughly understanding their mistakes. This 
dependency can stunt their natural learning process and development of self-editing skills. 
Iskender (2023) provided a critical perspective on this matter, arguing that the use of AI writing 
tools could lead to diminished critical thinking skills if students become overly dependent on them. 
They expressed concern that students might prioritize quick fixes from AI tools over deeply 
understanding and learning from their mistakes, which would essentially negate the process of 
learning, growth, and development in writing. In addition to concerns about over-reliance, the 
impact of AI writing tools on creativity has also been questioned. Some educators worry that 
students might use these tools not just for refining their language, but also for generating ideas, 
potentially curtailing their creative thinking and originality (Johinke et al., 2023). Furthermore, 
Farrokhnia et al. (2023) pointed out that while AI tools can improve certain writing skills, they may 
not be as effective in addressing higher-order writing elements, such as argument structure and 
coherence. These aspects require a deep understanding of the topic, logical thinking, and the 
ability to connect ideas, which are currently beyond the capacity of AI tools. In terms of tone and 
context, AI tools may also falter. These tools might not fully grasp the subtleties and nuances of 
human language and emotion, potentially leading to suggestions that may not be appropriate or 
accurate in a given context (Haleem et al., 2022). Finally, issues of digital equity have been raised. 
Not all students have equal access to these technologies, leading to potential disparities in 
learning outcomes. In their study, Mozumder et al. (2023) noted that students without access to 
high-speed internet or modern digital devices might be unable to utilize these AI tools, widening 
the educational achievement gap. Therefore, while the application of AI in writing instruction has 
promising benefits, educators need to be mindful of these potential drawbacks and address them 
proactively in their teaching strategies.
3. Method
3.1. Research design
To address the research questions, a qualitative approach was employed, specifically utilizing 
a case study methodology. The case study methodology, which typically involves conducting 
interviews and/or observations, enables the researcher to uncover important factors that emerge 
from the open-ended process (Yin, 2009). Through this methodology, we were able to explore in- 
depth the types of AI writing tools used by EFL teachers, as well as their perceptions about the 
impact of these tools on students’ writing quality, particularly in terms of content and 
organization.
3.2. Research participants
This study focused on gaining insights from EFL teachers experienced with AI writing tools, 
specifically their views on how these tools affect student’s writing quality, particularly in terms 
of content and organization. Four writing teachers were recruited from three different universities, 
one being a public institution and the other two, private. The selection was primarily based on their 
practical experience with AI writing tools in the classroom, accessibility, willingness to participate, 
and teaching expertise in advanced courses such as essay writing and argumentative essay 
writing. These advanced courses often demand a higher level of grammatical knowledge and 
a deeper understanding of discourse structure.
All the recruited teachers possessed at least three years of experience in teaching EFL and 
a minimum of one year’s experience in applying AI writing tools in their classrooms. These AI tools 
served as supplementary teaching resources, aiding in grammar checking, paraphrasing, plagiar­
ism detection, generating content, and offering suggestions to enhance the clarity and coherence 
of students’ writing. This ensured the teachers’ experiences transcended mere theoretical knowl­
edge, encapsulating practical applications of AI tools in real-life teaching scenarios.

Teachers’ classes varied in size, ranging from intimate, personalized instruction settings to larger, 
conventional classrooms. This range in teaching environments was intentional, allowing the study to 
account for various factors potentially impacting the efficacy of AI tools. These factors could include 
class size, available institutional resources, the composition of the student population, and individual 
teaching styles. Such a diverse selection of participants enabled a comprehensive understanding of 
EFL teachers’ experiences and perspectives while using AI writing tools.
Participants were designated as T1, T2, T3, and T4 to maintain confidentiality. The recruitment 
process began with contacting prospective participants via email, outlining the study’s purpose, 
their roles, data collection methods, and their rights, including the ability to withdraw from the 
study at any point without any repercussions. This ensured adherence to ethical research guide­
lines. They were also provided with an informed consent form to read, comprehend, and sign if 
they agreed to participate. Through this careful recruitment process, the study maintained the 
highest ethical standards while ensuring the inclusion of relevant experiences and perspectives. 
The demographic information of the participants is presented in Table 1.
3.3. Instrument
We used interviews as our research instrument to collect the required data for this study. This 
instrument allowed us to gather rich, qualitative data related to EFL teachers’ use of AI writing 
tools, and their perspectives on the impact of these tools on students’ writing quality- specifically, 
in terms of content and organization. To construct pertinent interview questions, we turned to 
several relevant pieces of literature. Works by Nazari et al. (2021), Dale and Viethen (2021), M. Lee 
et al. (2022), and Zhao (2022) served as valuable references. By undertaking an in-depth review of 
these sources, we focused on the topics and themes that aligned with our research objectives.
This thorough literature review helped us craft our interview protocol. It included specific 
questions such as “What AI writing tools have you used in your classroom?” and “In what ways 
have these tools impacted your students’ writing, specifically with respect to content and organi­
zation?” This interview guide allowed us to investigate both the practical applications and theore­
tical implications of AI writing tools in the EFL teaching context.
3.4. Data collection procedure
After designing the interview protocol centered on the types of AI writing tools utilized by EFL 
teachers and their views on the impact of these tools on student writing quality (specifically, 
content and organization), we organized interviews with each participant. These were scheduled 
according to their convenience and availability. Before starting each interview, we briefed the 
participants about the study’s objectives, the interview process, and our rigorous approach to data 
protection. We secured their informed consent to proceed, ensuring they comprehended their 
rights, including the freedom to withdraw from the study at any time. During the interview, we 
began with general questions about their experiences teaching EFL and using AI writing tools, thus

fostering a relaxed environment conducive for open discussions. Gradually, we introduced more 
specific questions aligned with our interview protocol, delving into the particular AI writing tools 
they had employed and their impact on students’ writing quality, particularly in terms of content 
and organization improvements.
To address potential social-desirability bias inherent in self-reported data, we emphasized to the 
participants that there were no right or wrong answers and encouraged them to be as open and 
honest as possible. This was done to ensure the reliability and authenticity of the responses 
gathered. Each interview was recorded with the participant’s permission, to maintain accuracy in 
capturing their responses, an integral part of reliable transcription and subsequent data analysis. 
Note-taking during the interviews was also employed as a means to highlight significant points, 
capture nuanced details, and document immediate observations.
Upon the conclusion of each interview, we expressed our gratitude to the participants for their 
contributions, also providing them with an opportunity to pose any questions about the study or to 
add any further comments. Following the interviews, we carefully transcribed the recorded dialo­
gues, transforming verbal insights into textual data. Accuracy during this stage is critical, as the 
transcribed data underpin our subsequent analysis. All collected data, encompassing the interview 
recordings, transcriptions, and notes, were securely stored, respecting participant privacy and 
enabling efficient data management for ensuing stages of data analysis and research reporting. 
Adhering to these practices ensured a comprehensive, ethical, and effective data collection 
procedure for our research on AI writing tools’ use and impact in EFL teaching.
3.5. Data analysis
We employed a thematic case study to analyze the qualitative data. As outlined by Braun and 
Clarke (2006), the goal of this thematic analysis was to identify patterns and connections among 
themes extracted from the qualitative data, thereby addressing our research questions. We 
divided the analysis into five distinct steps.
In the first step, we thoroughly read the interview transcript multiple times to familiarize 
ourselves with its content. The second step involved developing preliminary codes that grouped 
related words and phrases in line with our research criteria. Following a detailed analysis of these 
codes, we then categorized each one. In this step, we also compared the results to identify any 
relationships or patterns. Finally, we established a set of categories from these grouped codes.
4. Findings
4.1. Types of AI writing tools use by the EFL teachers
Drawing from the data collated during the interview phase of our research, it was evident that the 
four EFL teachers under study employed a range of AI writing tools in their teaching practice. 
These tools were chosen and used based on their distinctive features and capabilities, aligning with 
the unique demands of their teaching environments and objectives. To provide a detailed yet 
succinct overview of these AI writing tools, we have organized this data into a clear and informa­
tive format. Refer to Table 2, which serves as a comprehensive catalog, capturing the variety of AI 
writing tools adopted by these EFL teachers. This table effectively highlights the names of the AI 
tools in use and their specific purposes, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the current land­
scape of AI utilization in EFL teaching.
The provided dataset in Table 2 reveals a notable pattern of how four teachers (T1, T2, T3 and 
T4), integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in their teaching methodologies. These teachers had 
shared a common interest in utilizing a combination of AI tools in enhancing students’ writing 
skills, hinting at the fundamental trend of embedding technology into education.

Two tools, QuillBot and Wordtune, had emerged as universally used across all four teachers. 
QuillBot, known for its proficiency in paraphrasing, was an important part of teaching students how 
to express the same idea in different ways, effectively aiding in the avoidance of plagiarism. 
Wordtune, on the other hand, was employed to improve sentence structure and clarity, making 
it an essential tool in teaching English and enhancing students’ written expression.
A second layer of commonality could be seen with Jenni AI and ChatGPT, which were employed 
by three out of the four teachers (T1, T3, and T4). Jenni AI, renowned for its topic modeling 
capabilities, assisted students in brainstorming and organizing their thoughts prior to writing, 
thereby encouraging critical thinking and structured writing. Chat-GPT simulated conversations, 
assisting students in improving their conversational writing skills, which was a crucial aspect of 
English learning in a globalized and digitally connected world.
While the aforementioned tools were the common threads woven into the teaching methodol­
ogies of these teachers, they also diversified their approach with specific tools unique to their 
classrooms. For instance, T2 used Copy.ai and Paperpal. Copy.ai generated creative writing

samples, serving as examples for different styles of writing and thus, fostering creativity in 
students. Paperpal was utilized for its strength in grammar checks and providing real-time correc­
tions, which was a vital practice in English learning. T3 employed Essay Writer, which helped 
students structure their essays logically and provided them with ideas for improvements, a tool 
that seemed uniquely suited to a classroom focused on academic writing. T4 also brought in Copy. 
ai and Essay Writer, leveraging these tools to show students how to craft compelling pieces of 
writing in various styles and formats.
When considering the demographic information of participants given in Table 1 and analyzing it 
against the teachers’ utilization of AI tools, several initial observations become apparent. It 
appears that the teachers with more years of experience in using AIWT, T2 and T3, utilize 
a broader set of AI tools. Notably, T2, who is the oldest, holds the highest qualification (a Ph.D.) 
and has the most teaching experience, utilizes unique tools like Copy.ai and Paperpal. Similarly, T3, 
who has comparable AIWT experience, also uses a unique tool, Essay Writer. This pattern suggests 
that more seasoned and experienced teachers in using AIWT may exhibit greater confidence in 
exploring diverse AI tools for varying educational purposes. While it is challenging to conclude any 
significant gender-based differences in AI tool usage from this dataset, it is worth mentioning that 
the only female teacher, T2, uses a unique set of tools that could be more attributable to her 
experience and qualifications than her gender. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the level of 
teaching experience and qualifications may influence the use of AI tools. T2, having the highest 
teaching experience, experiments with unique tools, suggesting that more experienced teachers 
could be more exploratory. Similarly, the teacher with a Ph.D. degree, T2 again, utilizes unique AI 
tools, hinting that the level of education might have some influence on the choice of AI tools. 
However, given the small dataset, these observations need to be treated as preliminary trends 
rather than definitive conclusions.
4.2. Teachers perspective toward the impact of AI writing tools
In this section, we delved into the findings from our interviews regarding the teachers’ perspec­
tives on the impact of AI writing tools on students’ writing quality, specifically focusing on the 
aspects of content and organization.
4.2.1. Impact on the aspect of content writing
When examining the aspect of content, we identified two major sub-themes: idea generation and 
vocabulary and language use.
4.2.1.1. Idea generation. The responses from four teachers (T1, T2, T3, & T4) highlighted a wide 
range of opinions among them regarding the impact of AI writing tools on students’ creativity and 
ability to generate ideas. T1, for example, highlighted the potential benefits of AI writing tools, 
emphasizing their ability to stimulate creativity and idea expansion. According to him, these tools 
could offer various angles or perspectives when students were struggling with writer’s block, 
thereby helping them overcome creative obstacles. The teacher’s reply is as follows: 
AI writing tools have been instrumental in boosting students’ creativity by providing sug­
gestions and expanding on initial ideas. When students get stuck or encounter writer’s block, 
these tools can propose different angles or perspectives, assisting them in overcoming 
creative hurdles. . .. (T1) 
Conversely, T2 expressed a more mixed evaluation of AI writing tools. On one hand, she agreed 
with T1 that these tools could provide a kick-start when students grappled with idea generation. 
However, she also voiced a concern that the ideas produced by these tools could be rather generic 
or impersonal. In her view, while AI tools could assist in certain situations, they might not always 
promote deep or critical thinking about a topic. The teacher respond in the following manner:
Marzuki et al., Cogent Education (2023), 10: 2236469                                                                                                                                                     
https://doi.org/10.1080/2331186X.2023.2236469

## Page 11

In my experience, AI writing tools have had mixed effects on students’ abilities to generate 
ideas. On one hand, they can provide a starting point when a student struggles with idea 
generation. However, the ideas generated by the tool can be rather generic or lack personal 
touch. Therefore, while they can be helpful in some instances, they might not always 
encourage students to think deeply or critically about a topic. (T2) 
In contrast to the previous views, T3 brought a different perspective, suggesting that AI writing 
tools could potentially hamper students’ ability to generate original ideas. He posited that students 
might become overly reliant on the suggestions provided by the tool, limiting their willingness to 
think creatively or innovatively. He argued that struggling with idea generation and problem- 
solving might be beneficial in the long run as these were key skills that could be honed over 
time. The teacher offered the following response:
I’ve observed that AI writing tools can sometimes inhibit students’ ability to generate 
original ideas. This might be because they become reliant on the tool’s suggestions, and stop 
pushing themselves to think outside of the box. In some cases, it might be more beneficial 
for students to struggle with idea generation and problem-solving, as these are valuable 
skills that can be cultivated through practice. (T3) 
Lastly, T4 re-emphasized some positive aspects of AI writing tools, notably their capacity to aid 
students in developing their ideas further. He noted that these tools could offer phrases or 
sentences that enhanced an initial idea, showing students various ways to express their thoughts 
more effectively. Moreover, he stated that AI writing tools could demonstrate how an idea could 
be developed and supported with evidence or arguments, which he believed was especially 
beneficial in academic writing. The teacher response as follows:
AI writing tools have shown a positive impact on students’ ability to elaborate on their 
thoughts. These tools often provide phrases or sentences that extend an initial idea, 
enabling students to see different ways in which they can express their thoughts more 
effectively. Furthermore, these tools can show how an idea can be developed and supported 
with evidence or arguments, which can be particularly useful in academic writing. (T4) 
In summary, these responses suggested a spectrum of views on the influence of AI writing tools 
on students’ creativity and idea generation, underscoring both potential benefits and drawbacks. 
While some teachers viewed these tools as useful aids for overcoming creative blocks and devel­
oping ideas, others warned against over-reliance and the risk of limiting critical thinking and 
personal creativity. The overall message underscored the need for a balanced use of AI tools, 
fostering both creative assistance and independent thought.
4.2.1.2. Vocabulary and language use. In relation to the vocabulary and language use, each 
teacher had drawn attention to a specific aspect, while acknowledging both benefits and potential 
downsides. T1, for instance, had underscored the positive influence of AI writing tools on enhan­
cing students’ vocabulary. He suggested that these tools recommended synonyms or more 
advanced words that students might not have considered, thereby expanding their lexical reper­
toire and enabling them to express their ideas more precisely and engagingly. Over time, he 
believed this led to more advanced and polished writing. 
I have noticed a significant positive impact of AI writing tools on students’ vocabulary use. 
These tools often suggest synonyms or more sophisticated words that students might not 
have thought to use on their own. As a result, students’ lexical repertoire expands, and they 
can express their thoughts in a more nuanced and engaging way. Over time, their writing 
becomes more advanced and polished. (T1) 
T2, however, had introduced a note of caution. She had expressed worries that AI writing tools 
could sometimes result in overcomplicated language. While she acknowledged the potential of

these tools to provide students with a more complex vocabulary, she voiced concerns that 
students might use these words without fully understanding their context or connotations, 
which could lead to awkward or excessively formal writing. She emphasized that while expanding 
vocabulary was beneficial, the primary goals should always be clarity and precision. The transcript 
of the interview is provided below:
. . . While these tools can provide students with more complex vocabulary, students may use 
these words without fully understanding their context or connotations. This can lead to 
sentences that sound awkward or overly formal. (T2) 
T3 presented a more balanced view, acknowledging the usefulness of AI writing tools as a learning 
resource for expanding vocabulary. However, he also cautioned against an over-reliance on these 
tools. He expressed concerns that students might not make an effort to recall and use the new 
vocabulary independently. Further, he warned that this could potentially slow students’ vocabulary 
acquisition over the long term. Emphasizing the need for balance, he stressed the importance of 
using these tools as a supplementary aid rather than a crutch. The excerpt from the interview is 
displayed below:
AI writing tools can provide a helpful learning resource for students to learn and use new 
vocabulary. However, there is a risk of students becoming overly reliant on these tools and 
not making the effort to remember and independently use the new words they encoun­
ter. (T3) 
Lastly, T4 took the conversation in a slightly different direction, focusing on the role of AI writing 
tools in reducing repetition in students’ writing. He argued that these tools could suggest varied 
vocabulary to replace frequently used words or phrases, thereby enhancing the quality of their 
writing and prompting students to incorporate new vocabulary into their work.
. . .when a student tends to use a particular word or phrase frequently, the tool can suggest 
different options to diversify the language used. This not only enhances the overall quality of 
their writing but also encourages students to incorporate new vocabulary into their work. 
(T4)  
4.2.2. Impact on writing organization
As for the aspect of organization, we also distinguished two prominent sub-themes: “Coherence 
and Logical Flow” and “Use of Transition Words and Phrases”. “Coherence and Logical Flow” 
explores how AI writing tools impact students’ ability to construct logical and cohesive arguments 
or narratives. Meanwhile, “Use of Transition Words and Phrases” centers on whether these tools 
assist students in effectively using transitional language elements to link ideas, thus enhancing the 
fluidity of their writing.
4.2.2.1. Coherence and logical flow. The responses of the four teachers presented a comprehensive 
picture of the benefits of AI writing tools in enhancing students’ writing skills. Each teacher provided 
insights into a distinct facet of these tools and their impact on the writing process.
Firstly, T1 underscored the overall positive impact of AI writing tools, emphasizing their role in 
fostering a clear, logical flow of thoughts. T1 noted how these tools helped in suggesting better 
phrasing, removing redundancies, and enhancing coherence, which subsequently improved stu­
dents’ confidence in their writing abilities. The teacher’s response is presented below.
. . . The tools facilitate a clear, logical flow of thoughts by suggesting better phrasing, removing 
redundancies, and enhancing coherence. Students tend to write more confidently knowing that 
the tool is there to guide them . . . . (T1) 
Marzuki et al., Cogent Education (2023), 10: 2236469

Secondly, T2 offered a balanced perspective, reflecting both on the positives and potential downsides 
of these tools. T2 highlighted the assistance provided by AI in organizing thoughts, structuring 
arguments, and identifying logical gaps. Yet, T2 also raised concerns about possible over-reliance 
on these tools, which could have inadvertently led students to overlook the development of their 
own critical thinking and problem-solving skills, fundamental to effective writing. The pieces of their 
interview is presented as follow:
. . .these tools are great for helping students organize their thoughts, structure their argu­
ments, and identify gaps in their logic. . . .. however, students may become over-reliant on 
these tools, leading them to overlook their development in critical thinking and problem- 
solving skills integral to effective writing. (T2) 
Next, T3 built upon these insights by focusing on the instant feedback provided by AI writing tools. 
According to T3, these tools served as an invaluable aid in structuring arguments, identifying 
logical inconsistencies, and encouraging clear communication. The ability to correct and learn from 
mistakes in real-time reinforced students’ understanding of good writing practices and contributed 
significantly to their writing skill improvement over time. The response is presented below:
. . . AI writing tools offer invaluable aid in structuring arguments, identifying logical incon­
sistencies, and encouraging clear communication. The instant feedback they provide allows 
students to correct and learn from their mistakes in real-time, thereby reinforcing their 
understanding of good writing practices. (T3) 
Lastly, T4 highlighted the role of AI tools as personalized writing tutors. This teacher emphasized 
their effectiveness in providing grammar suggestions, enhancing vocabulary usage, and ensuring 
logical continuity of arguments. In T4’s perspective, the AI writing tools had been instrumental in 
elevating students’ writing capabilities, particularly in creating logically coherent and flowing 
pieces of writing. The interview transcript is presented below.
AI writing tools have been instrumental in elevating students’ writing capabilities, especially 
in creating logically coherent and flowing pieces of writing. By providing grammar sugges­
tions, enhancing vocabulary usage, and ensuring logical continuity of arguments, these tools 
have effectively functioned as personalized writing tutors. (T4) 
4.2.2.2. Use of transition words and phrases. The four teachers’ statements are all in agreement 
regarding the impact of AI writing tools on students’ use of transition words and phrases in their 
writing. They all stress the significant improvement in the quality of writing resulting from the 
adoption of such AI tools.
T1 had spoken positively about the impact of AI writing tools on students’ writing, emphasizing 
an observed improvement in the use of transition words and phrases. They highlighted the 
educational nature of the tools, comparing them to an “interactive tutorial” that had helped 
students better understand the function and application of transitional elements in text. This 
suggested that T1 had seen AI tools as effective complementary educational resources. 
A portion of the interview transcript can be found below:
“Yes, I have certainly noticed a substantial improvement in students’ use of transition words 
and phrases after we incorporated AI writing tools into our program. The AI tool has helped 
them understand the application of such transitional elements in a text, which consequently 
improved the flow and organization of their written works. It’s like they have an ongoing 
interactive tutorial that guides them in developing better writing techniques”. (T1) 
Following this, T2 also recognized the benefits of AI writing tools in enhancing the use of transi­
tional elements. They mentioned improvements in sentence flow and cohesion. However, differing 
slightly from T1, T2 offered a more nuanced perspective by raising potential concerns regarding 
the dependency on these tools. They warned that over-reliance might impact students’ creativity 
Marzuki et al., Cogent Education (2023), 10: 2236469

and unique writing styles. This had suggested that while T2 appreciated the benefits of the tools, 
they also recognized the need for balanced use. The transcript the interview can be seen below.
“Yes, indeed, there’s a noticeable improvement in the way students use transition words and 
phrases after incorporating AI writing tools. Their sentences seem to flow better, with 
clearer connections between ideas, suggesting a better understanding of cohesion in writ­
ing. Nevertheless, it’s also worth noting that, on the flip side, some students may become 
overly dependent on these tools, running the risk of stifling their personal creativity and 
unique writing styles. As with all technologies, the key lies in balanced use and ongoing 
guidance”. (T2) 
Subsequently, T3 emphasized the immediacy of the impact that AI writing tools could have had on 
student writing. They spoke about how the tools offered real-time prompts that helped students 
incorporate transitional elements while their thoughts were still fresh, contributing to improved 
organization and clarity. T3 s perspective seemed to focus on the capacity of AI writing tools to 
promote active and timely learning. The interview transcript is presented below. 
“Honestly, there has been a noticeable enhancement in students ability to logically connect 
their ideas using transition words and phrases after the adoption of AI writing tools. The AI 
models offer real-time prompts, ensuring students incorporate these vital elements while 
the ideas are still fresh in their minds. This way, the organization and clarity of their essays 
significantly improve”. (T3) “Honestly, there has been a noticeable enhancement in students 
Finally, T4 provided a before-and-after comparison, which implied a significant improvement in 
students’ writing after the introduction of AI tools. He spoke to the tools’ potential in facilitating 
smoother transitions between ideas and improved coherence and organization in writing. This 
suggested T4 perceived the AI tools as beneficial for mitigating common writing issues and 
enhancing overall writing quality. The teacher’s response is presented below.
“AI writing tools have definitely made a difference. Prior to their use, students would often 
skip transition words or misuse them, leading to disjointed writing. However, with the AI 
tools’ guidance, the students have started to see how these transitions provide a smooth 
pathway from one idea to the next, and have begun using them more effectively. This tool 
has undeniably facilitated better organization and coherence in students’ writing”. (T4) 
In conclusion, all the responses were largely positive about the impact of AI writing tools on 
students’ writing, although they each focused on slightly different benefits. However, T2 had 
injected a note of caution about potential over-reliance on the tools, hinting at the importance 
of maintaining a balance in their use.
5. Discussion
The objective of this study was to explore the various types of AI writing tools and their influence 
on the quality of student writing—particularly in terms of content and organization—as perceived 
by EFL (English as a Foreign Language) teachers. The initial findings of the current research 
underscored the diverse array of Artificial Intelligence (AI) writing tools (e.g., Quilbot, Jenni, Chat- 
GPT, WordTune, Copy.ai, Paperpal and Essay writer) utilized by teachers of English as a Foreign 
Language (EFL). The EFL teachers shared a common interest in utilizing a combination of AI tools 
in enhancing students’ writing skills, hinting at the fundamental trend of embedding technology 
into education. This is in line with the work of C. Liu et al. (2021), who emphasized the incorpora­
tion of multiple AI tools in enhancing the teaching-learning process. In their study, they observed 
that a combination of AI tools can foster a more comprehensive learning environment, especially 
for enhancing writing skills in EFL students. Similarly, Ouyang et al. (2022) studied the impact of AI 
in education, and their findings corroborate our research. They noted a growing trend among 
teachers to use a blend of AI tools to enrich the learning experience and found that this had 
a positive impact on students’ overall academic performance, including their writing skills.

The second findings from our research examined the impact of AI writing tools on the content 
and organization of second-language writing. In the realm of content, which refers to the gen­
eration of ideas and their articulation, AI writing tools have shown promising potential. Wong and 
Mak (2019) note that the content of L2 writing, in particular, is often shaped by students’ linguistic 
abilities and their cultural backgrounds. AI writing tools, with their capacity for providing prompts 
and suggesting improvements, can support students in articulating their thoughts and enhancing 
the richness of their content (Y. Liu et al., 2023). Moreover, a study by Gayed et al. (2022) found 
that AI writing tools can be instrumental in fostering idea development, thus aiding students in 
overcoming creative blocks. This aligns with our findings, where teachers (T1, T3 & T4) acknowl­
edged these tools as beneficial for nurturing idea generation. However, potential downsides were 
also noted, such as the risk of over-reliance on these tools potentially limiting critical thinking and 
personal creativity, as raised by T2 and supported by Huang and Tan (2023). They argued that 
excessive dependence on AI technologies may decrease one’s ability to think creatively and 
critically, as well as impair the capacity to make autonomous assessments regarding the standard 
of writing.
In terms of organization, which encompasses the logical arrangement and coherence of ideas, 
AI writing tools have been found to provide valuable assistance. According to Bowen and Thomas 
(2020), the organization of ideas is a critical component of L2 writing, and students often struggle 
with establishing coherence and logical progression in their texts. Here, AI writing tools can 
provide instantaneous feedback and suggestions for reorganizing sentences and paragraphs, 
thus helping students improve the structure of their writing (T. S. Chang et al., 2021). In our 
study, all four participating teachers (T1, T2, T3, and T4) recognized the positive role of AI writing 
tools in enhancing the clarity of student writing and promoting a logical progression of thoughts 
and arguments. These findings align with the research by Malik et al. (2023), who suggested that 
AI tools can be instrumental in improving the organization of L2 writing. However, it is also crucial 
to note the potential risks.
Additionally, the teachers in this study (T1, T2, T3, & T4) presented diverse perspectives on the 
influence of AI writing tools on students’ vocabulary use and growth. While certain participants 
(i.e., T1, T3, & T4) recognized apparent advantages, such as vocabulary enhancement and mini­
mization of repetition, others (i.e., T2) urged caution about potential downsides, including overly 
complex language and an excessive dependence on these tools. Again, this is supported by the 
research conducted by Gayed et al. (2022). They too investigated the impact of AI writing tools on 
students’ vocabulary use and development. They found that these tools offer clear advantages, 
such as broadening vocabulary and reducing repetitive language use. Furthermore, the study by 
Fitria (2021) aligns with our findings. They underlined the role of AI tools in enhancing vocabulary 
but also cautioned against over-dependence, emphasizing the importance of these tools being 
used as aids rather than substitutes for comprehensive language learning.
The next point of discussion focused on the teachers’ views regarding the impact of AI writing 
tools on organizational aspects of writing. All four teachers (T1, T2, T3, and T4) recognized the 
positive role these tools play in enhancing the clarity of student writing and promoting a logical 
progression of thoughts and arguments. They unanimously agreed on the tools’ proficiency in 
recommending more effective wording, detecting logical inconsistencies, and aiding in the orga­
nization of arguments. However, T2 provided a balanced perspective, appreciating both the 
benefits and potential drawbacks of these tools. Particularly, T2 expressed concern over the 
possibility that students could become overly reliant on these tools, which could inadvertently 
inhibit the growth of their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This concern aligns with the 
findings of Malik et al. (2023), who suggested that excessive reliance on AI tools can result in 
reduced efforts in critical thinking among students.
The study has a few limitations, however, that need to be addressed. One potential limitation is 
the possible bias in participant selection. The teachers who participated in our research are

currently using and actively promoting the use of AI writing tools, which could predispose the 
findings towards more positive experiences and attitudes. Acknowledging this, it is recommended 
that future research should include teachers who have tried these tools but have decided not to 
continue using them. This would present a more balanced perspective and help in understanding 
the reasons for discontinuation and any potential barriers to effective implementation of these 
tools in the classroom.
6. Conclusion
This study aimed to examine various types of AI writing tools and their influence on the quality of 
student writing, focusing on content and organization, from the perspective of EFL teachers. The 
findings revealed a diverse array of AI writing tools employed in EFL teaching and shed light on the 
strategies teachers use to integrate these tools to address students’ writing challenges. In parti­
cular, the tools, including Quillbot, Jenni, Chat-GPT, WordTune, Copy.ai, Paperpal, and Essay writer, 
were found to foster a comprehensive learning environment and enrich students’ overall academic 
performance. The study also found unanimous agreement among the teachers about the positive 
role of AI writing tools in enhancing the clarity and logical progression of students’ writing. 
However, concerns were expressed about the possibility of students becoming overly reliant on 
these tools, which could inhibit their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The study’s 
implications suggest the integration of AI writing tools can be beneficial in enhancing the quality 
of EFL student writing.
While the present study provides insightful revelations regarding the use of AI writing tools in 
EFL classrooms, there are several limitations that should be noted. Firstly, the data was obtained 
from only four EFL teachers from three universities in Indonesia, which limits the breadth of the 
study. Different regions may have varying degrees of access to technology, resources, and the 
attitudes of teachers towards AI tools, and this study may not fully represent the experiences of 
teachers in different contexts. Additionally, the teachers who participated in our research are 
currently using and actively promoting the use of AI writing tools, which could predispose the 
findings towards more positive experiences and attitudes. This potential bias in participant selec­
tion should be acknowledged. To address this limitation, it is recommended that future research 
includes teachers who have tried these tools but have decided not to continue using them. This 
would present a more balanced perspective and help in understanding the reasons for disconti­
nuation and any potential barriers to effective implementation of these tools in the classroom. 
Furthermore, the study focused solely on teachers’ perceptions and did not incorporate students’ 
views or measure their actual improvements in writing skills due to the use of these AI tools. 
Therefore, it may not present a complete picture of the impact of AI writing tools on students’ 
writing quality. Furthermore, the research did not examine the long-term effects of using AI tools 
on students’ writing skills, nor did it investigate the potential negative effects of students’ over- 
dependence on AI tools, which was a concern raised by some teachers. It is important to address 
these limitations in future research to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the implica­
tions and potential drawbacks associated with the use of AI writing tools in EFL classrooms
