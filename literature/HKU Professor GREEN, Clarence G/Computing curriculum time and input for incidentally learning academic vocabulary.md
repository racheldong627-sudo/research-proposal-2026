Computing curriculum time and input for 
incidentally learning academic vocabulary

Abstract 
This paper computes estimates of the potential for Extensive Reading (ER) and Extensive Viewing (EV) to 
support the academic and discipline-specific vocabulary needs of students. While research into ER/EV for 
general vocabulary is well-established, only recently has academic vocabulary begun to be researched. 
Given curriculum time constraints, information on which academic vocabulary items might be learnable 
incidentally is useful, and this study provides teachers with information on which specific academic 
vocabulary items from multiple academic wordlists have a reasonable chance of being learned incidentally. 
It operationalizes ER/EV through corpora representing general fiction, television programs, and movies. 
It estimates the pedagogical time it would take to meet target vocabulary at different possible thresholds 
for incidental learning (6, 12, 20 times) with estimates for each computed for multiple possible reading 
rates (100, 260, 350 wpm) and viewing rates (80, 140, 200 wpm). Results report individual curriculum 
time/input estimates for over 2000 academic vocabulary targets across multiple subjects. Findings indicate 
ER/EV are pedagogies that could substantially support academic vocabulary development. A tool is 
released for teachers to compute personalized estimates using the reading rates of their students.

Introduction 
This paper estimates computationally the potential for Extensive Reading (ER) and Extensive Viewing 
(EV) to support the academic and discipline-specific vocabulary needs of students. Research into ER/EV 
for general vocabulary within second language acquisition has been extensive (Webb, 2020), with the 
foundational paper from a computing perspective published in the current journal (Cobb, 2007). However, 
research into EV/ER to support academic and disciplinary vocabulary has only recently emerged. For 
example, Dang (2019) analyzed medical vocabulary in an EV corpus of medical television and McQuillan 
(2019) explored general academic vocabulary in an ER corpus of juvenile fiction. Both studies suggest 
significant amounts of academic/discipline-specific vocabulary are available from ER/EV, at rates 
potentially adequate for incidental learning within feasible pedagogical timeframes.  
However, information that teachers/researchers do not yet have includes how much discipline-specific 
vocabulary is available in general ER/EV (i.e., corpora representing constructs of pleasure 
reading/viewing), an important component of most ER/EV approaches. Specialized vocabulary, such as 
those found in Dang (2019), may be broadly available. If teachers had this information for multiple 
disciplines, they would have a better sense of the potential of ER/EV for supporting disciplinary vocabulary. 
Further, estimates of input quantity and curriculum time would be valuable for specific vocabulary targets 
at multiple reading/viewing rates. This information needs to be provided in an easily accessible tool with 
the possibility of adjusting input rates for the needs of particular students. Finally, a larger corpus study 
than previously researched is required to not underestimate/overestimate the presence of academic

vocabulary through sampling bias, which is a possible limitation of McQuillan’s (2019) analysis of 
academic vocabulary in a corpus of 22 novels (1 million words).  
The following study therefore contributes a large-scale analysis of the Academic Word List (AWL) and 
Secondary Vocabulary Lists (SVL) in corpora representing possible ER/EV constructs, reporting which 
academic words are present in the input, which are not, and which might have the potential to be acquired 
incidentally. Curriculum time estimates for both general academic vocabulary and specialized vocabulary 
(chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics) are computed for variable reading/viewing rates. This study 
packages this information as a resource for teachers that allows for estimates to be adjusted according to 
their students and contexts. The aim of this study is to help teachers in planning which vocabulary they 
might be able to target through ER/EV and which they may decide to target through alternative pedagogies. 
Extensive Reading and Viewing as Vocabulary Pedagogies 
Extensive Reading (ER) is a collection of pedagogical approaches characterized by allowing students time 
to read widely material of interest, without necessarily requiring assessment. The pedagogy is also known 
as pleasure reading, free self-selected reading and sustained silent reading (Krashen, 2020). Renandya and 
Jacobs (2016, p. 98) characterize ER as consisting of a large amount of reading over extended time, with a 
focus on general comprehension rather than vocabulary learning. The focus on comprehension leads ER 
researchers to emphasize reading material be at an appropriate level, possibly no more than 2-5% of the 
vocabulary unknown (Hiebert, 2020). To ensure comprehensible input, several strategies can be used, either 
graded readers (Nation, 2014), teacher-librarian assistance, or free self-selected reading where students 
choose any text they want but are encouraged to put down anything too difficult or uninteresting and choose 
something else (Krashen, 2020). ER is a long-term curriculum commitment from weeks to years, and the 
longer students engage in ER, the more vocabulary is learned (Uchihara et al., 2019). The effectiveness of 
ER for vocabulary development is by now well established (Reynolds, 2020; Webb, 2020), and it is a rich 
pedagogy that supports literacy goals such as the enjoyment of literature and what this offers in terms of 
socio-cultural and cognitive development.  
Extensive Viewing (EV) is a newer field of research/pedagogy that carries over much of the theory from 
ER. Webb (2020, p. 227) notes that as with ER, the current evidence is that EV effectively promotes 
vocabulary gains through incidental learning. Renandya and Jacobs (2016, p. 98) consider EV a type of 
extensive listening given the input is speech, but with additional benefits of visual support. EV, as 
operationalized by Webb (2015), “involves regular silent uninterrupted viewing of L2 television inside and 
outside of the classroom… including L2 movies… to improve vocabulary learning through increasing the 
amount of meaning-focused spoken input” (p. 161). EV can be enhanced by subtitles/closed captions 
(Peters, 2019). Understanding more about EV as a source of academic vocabulary input is important, given 
that Webb (2015, p. 159) cites figures for the average hours spent watching television ranging from 2.43 a 
day in Sweden to 8.18 hours in the United States. For reluctant readers, EV may be an appropriate 
scaffolding pedagogy if it can be shown to contain repeated encounters with academic vocabulary. 
Incidental Vocabulary Learning and Repetition 
Incidental vocabulary learning refers to vocabulary acquired within a meaning-focused task (e.g., reading 
comprehension) in which vocabulary learning is a by-product rather than the conscious focus of attention. 
Fundamental to incidental learning is repetition (Nation, 2014) and, while no number of encounters 
guarantees acquisition (Webb, 2020, p. 225), there has been extensive research exploring how many times 
target vocabulary may need to be encountered for incidental learning. A foundational study by Webb (2007) 
involved 121 L2 participants across four experimental groups. One experimental group encountered target 
words once, a second group 3 times, a third 7 times, and a fourth 10 times. Results indicated a general 
relationship between the number of repetitions and performance when tested, with significant incidental 
learning at 10 repetitions–a threshold at which students potentially can acquire “spelling, meaning, part of 
speech, words that it is associated with… [and] grammatical accuracy” (Webb, 2007, p. 62).

Vidal (2011) considered both reading and listening, taking three academic texts and lectures as input and 
testing the retention of 36 vocabulary targets at variable frequencies in a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest 
design. Participants included 248 first year undergraduates in an ESP tourism course across reading, 
listening and control groups. Vidal (2011, p. 247) reports regressions indicating, for reading, significant 
retention gains after three encounters with consistent retention increases from three to five repetitions, but 
no significant differences between five to six encounters. In the listening condition, retention gains started 
from three to five repetitions, with significant differences between five to six encounters. Overall, the study 
suggests participants needed higher rates of exposure for incidental vocabulary learning through listening 
than reading.  
A recent meta-analysis by Uchihara et al. (2019) reviews multiple research estimates of the number of 
repetitions associated with incidental learning, including variations in these estimates depending on the 
student cohort and depth of vocabulary knowledge targeted. For native speakers, ten is cited as a possible 
threshold, while for L2 cohorts, estimates for form-meaning mappings range from two to four repetitions, 
eight to ten for more depth, and from 10 to 17 for associations and collocations. 12 encounters is noted as 
an oft-cited general estimate. Results of the meta-analysis indicate that incidental learning of vocabulary is 
probabilistic, with estimates ranging from a 36% to 54% chance of success, and no number of encounters 
consistently associated with acquisition. Nevertheless, the relationship between repetition and incidental 
learning is highly significant (r = .34) with mode of input (i.e., reading, viewing, listening) all significantly 
associated with acquisition at 0.41, 0.22 and 0.39 respectively. In sum, while quasi-experimental research 
has found certain repetition thresholds that result in more incidental learning than others, and these numbers 
are useful (Nation, 2014) for research and curriculum planning, no magic number can be given to teachers 
for all students, all contexts, nor all vocabulary. 
Corpus Approaches to ER/EV as Input for Incidental Vocabulary Learning 
Using estimates such as those cited above, a stream of research in corpus linguistics has involved computing 
the amount of input required from ER/EV for the number of encounters possibly needed for incidental 
vocabulary learning. The theoretical framework often being tested in corpus ER/EV research has been the 
pleasure reading (or viewing) hypothesis, situated within the broader framework of compelling 
comprehensible input (Krashen, 2020). A goal of researchers is to determine how far proficiency might 
develop by students self-selecting input that interests them. The research debate centers on the efficiency, 
efficacy and extent of incidental vocabulary learning compared to pedagogical options such as direct 
instruction (McQuillan, 2019).    
The foundational study in this area is Cobb (2007), published in the current journal. He computed the 
frequencies of the first 3000 vocabulary items in the British National Corpus (BNC) in multiple possible 
representations of ER (175,000 words of general fiction; 163,000 words of newspapers; 179,000 words of 
academic texts) in order to estimate whether ER could provide this vocabulary frequently enough for 
incidental learning. Cobb (2007, p. 40) randomly selected 20 vocabulary samples from the 1000, 2000, and 
3000 BNC word frequency bands, computing their frequency in the target corpora using six occurrences as 
the minimal threshold for incidental learning. Finding numerous vocabulary targets below six repetitions, 
Cobb (2007) concludes that explicit vocabulary teaching should supplement ER because the input required 
from ER to meet the incidental learning threshold would be too great, and hence the pedagogy would take 
too long to be a plausible solution to providing the vocabulary students need. 
Nation (2014) states from his prior research that 98% of vocabulary in a text needs to be known for 
comprehension and that the first 9000 word families of English provides this coverage. He computes how 
much ER would be required to develop this vocabulary size incidentally. Nation sets an incidental learning 
threshold of 12 encounters as possibly “enough repetition … for learning to occur” (p. 12) and uses 25 
novels from Project Gutenberg as a proxy for ER. In this corpus, he reports that from the 1000-2000 
frequency band of the BNC, 805 targets would be encountered at least 12 times with approximately 171,411 
words of input, equivalent to about two novels. Reading about three novels more with an additional 300,219 
words of input would provide 830 targets from the 2-3000 frequency band, and so forth until after

approximately 2,956,908 words of input or 25 novels, students would have encountered 80% of the first 
9000 words of the BNC at least 12 times, which Nation concludes may be “often enough to have a chance 
of learning them” (p. 7). He then asks if this amount of input is possible, computing how long it would take 
with reading rates of 150 and 200 words per minute. He reports that with about six hours per week, 40 
weeks a year, or one to two hours of reading a day, it is possible to acquire the vocabulary needed for 
general comprehension within three to six years. 
Researchers have used different reading, speech and listening rates in wpm for estimating curriculum time. 
As noted, Nation (2014) used a reading rate of 150 and 200 wpm. The current estimate for average reading 
rates amongst proficient adults based on a meta-analysis is 260 wpm with more advanced readers potentially 
reading up to 350 wpm (Brysbaert, 2019). In the study that follows, to provide useful information for slower 
readers, average readers and more proficient readers, three reading rates are computed providing curriculum 
time estimates for 100, 260 and 350 wpm. For EV, while the current best estimate of the average speech 
rate is 120-180 wpm (Brysbaert, 2019), there is significant variation reported in TV programs and movies. 
Nation (2014, p. 9) suggests a two-hour movie with 10,000 tokens equates to 83 words per minute. Spanos 
and Smith (1990) report the closed caption rate for Sesame Street is 60 wpm, Reading Rainbow 120 wpm, 
and ABC Evening News 250 wpm. Romero-Fresco (2016, p. 61) reports an average 141 wpm with a range 
from 74-231 wpm. In the present study, EV curriculum time estimates are therefore computed for three 
possible input rates approximating the range reported in previous research, namely 80, 140 and 200 wpm. 
Corpus Approaches to ER/EV as Input for Academic Vocabulary 
Research has begun to emerge considering the potential for ER/EV to facilitate the incidental learning of 
academic vocabulary. Academic vocabulary can be divided into general academic vocabulary that is 
widespread across subjects and discipline-specific vocabulary associated with particular subjects (Green, 
2020). The extent to which these are mastered has an impact on student success, so it is an important 
research and pedagogical question as to how best to ensure the acquisition of this vocabulary (Crosthwaite 
& Cheung, 2019).  
The Academic Word List (AWL) (Coxhead, 2000) has been the most widely used and researched 
representation of general academic vocabulary (Dang, 2020, p. 289). McQuillan (2019) compiled a 
1,025,943-word ER corpus from 22 novels of recent, popular fiction (e.g., Twilight) and computed 
occurrences of AWL vocabulary in this data. He reports that 484 of 570 (85%) AWL words occur in his 
ER corpus, indicating that ER could support incidental learning of the AWL as it provides substantial 
exposure to general academic vocabulary. McQuillan (2019) then computes which AWL targets occur at 
multiple potential thresholds for incidental learning, namely 10, 12 and 25 recurrences in the ER corpus. 
McQuillan’s (2019) estimates are that between 113 (20%) to 213 (37%) AWL targets could be acquired 
incidentally through ER, depending on the number of encounters targeted. 
Focusing on discipline-specific vocabulary, Dang (2019) explored the potential for incidentally learning 
medical vocabulary through extensive viewing of medical television dramas. Dang (2019) developed a 
wordlist of 895 vocabulary targets from university lectures/seminars. Then, in a corpus of medical 
television (11,036,771 words), computed which would be encountered through EV and how frequently they 
occurred per episode, per season, all seasons and overall in the corpus. Using multiple possible thresholds 
for incidental learning, namely above 5, 10, 15, or 20, Dang reports “great potential for incidental learning” 
(p. 16), such as 76.26% of the specialized vocabulary encountered at least 5 times by watching multiple 
seasons of a program, 66.63% encountered 10 times, 60.73% 15 times, and 56.74% 20 times. If all seasons 
of all 37 programs in the corpus were viewed, 99.44% of the medical vocabulary would be attested 20 times 
or more.  
For comparability with McQuillan (2019) and because it is so widely used (Dang, 2020) (making the results 
of this study of interest to a wide number of teachers), the AWL represents general academic vocabulary in 
the current study. Discipline-specific vocabulary is represented by the Secondary Vocabulary Lists (SVL), 
with 880 vocabulary targets for Biology, 519 for Chemistry, 253 for Mathematics, and 546 for Physics. The

SVL is the most extensive and recent vocabulary profile available for multiple disciplines in an L2 context 
(Green & Lambert, 2018). An added benefit of considering disciplinary vocabulary from the secondary/pre-
tertiary level is that Uchihara et al. (2019, p. 584) find particularly strong incidental learning effects in 
secondary school, making it an educational context particularly worth exploring in relation to ER/EV.  
The following study explores vocabulary profiled as useful for L2 secondary/pre-tertiary students, and is 
situated within L2 ER/EV research. However, an exciting aspect of ER research is that it has implications 
for many educational contexts (Green, 2020). Krashen (2004, 2020) has long argued that case histories, 
quasi-experimental and corpus research demonstrate pleasure-reading supports both monolingual and 
bilingual vocabulary, students in mainstream schools as well as in ESL or EFL contexts, and K-12 and adult 
learners. There is also methodological cross-pollination. Hiebert (2020) and Graves et al. (2019), prominent 
educational researchers in early literacy, have recently drawn on the methods of L2 corpus vocabulary 
research in ER to compute vocabulary recurrences and profiles of reading material in primary school, 
arguing for ER as a pedagogy to provide an essential early reading vocabulary. 
This Study 
Gallagher et al. (2019) note, “consideration of whether instruction is explicit or incidental is important given 
the time constraints teachers face when integrating content with literacy practices that are essential for all 
students” (p. 100). This study aims to provide teachers with information on which academic vocabulary 
items have a chance of being learned incidentally through ER/EV. It estimates the time it would take to 
meet the target vocabulary from the AWL and multiple disciplines in the SVL (chemistry, biology, physics, 
mathematics) at different possible thresholds for incidental learning, namely 6, 12 and 20 times. Estimates 
for each of these are computed for multiple possible reading rates, namely 100, 260, 350 wpm, and viewing 
rates, 80, 140, 200 wpm. The study does not aim at testing EV/ER effectiveness in comparison with explicit 
instruction, an important question but beyond the scope of this study. The contribution of this study is to 
examine what AWL/SVL words can be met by reading and viewing authentic materials, and how often. 
This study adds important information to recent work on academic vocabulary in ER/EV. McQuillan’s 
(2019) study of the AWL sampled a small ER corpus, possibly resulting in underestimates/overestimates 
of how much of the AWL is accessible through fiction. Teachers/researchers also do not have equivalent 
information on AWL affordances within EV. Dang (2019) notes “it is crucial to identify potential resources 
for incidental learning of specialized vocabulary” (p. 2) and this motivates her study of medical vocabulary 
in medical television. Yet discipline-specific vocabulary may be more broadly available. Potential resources 
could include general fiction, television and movies. Importantly, since a wide range of disciplines have 
not been studied, teachers do not have a broad picture of how far ER/EV can support the core vocabulary 
of multiple subjects.  
Input should be compelling (Krashen, 2020) and this is why Dang (2020) examined medical dramas as a 
possible source of input for medical vocabulary, arguing medical professionals would presumably find it 
compelling. Therefore, if medical vocabulary frequently occurs in such television, then EV incorporating 
this material could be pedagogically useful. Yet as Krashen (2020) notes, current pedagogical advice to 
teachers is that informational and non-fiction texts be used to develop students’ academic language, when 
it is much more likely that allowing them to choose fiction that interests them would be compelling. 
Research is therefore needed to evaluate if fiction contains the specialized vocabulary of academics, and at 
what rates. 
This study focuses on the following two research questions:  
1) Which academic vocabulary from the AWL and SVL are attested (i.e., present) in ER/EV input, and 
which are not? 
2) For attested vocabulary, how much input would be required to encounter them 6, 12 and 20 times, and 
how long would this take for ER input at 100, 260, 350 wpm and EV input at 80, 140, 200 wpm?

The supplementary materials that accompany this study contain the further contribution of a tool for 
teachers, available here, that lists the individual ER/EV curriculum time/input estimates of over 2000 
academic words from the AWL and SVL. Teachers can select, based on the profile of their students and 
their available curriculum time, which specific vocabulary items they might target through ER/EV. The 
tool, in the form of spreadsheets, also allows teachers to compute their own estimates using the reading 
rates of their students. There are simple online tools for computing reading rates in wpm, and the columns 
in the excel sheet are functions (e.g., [=H2/260/60]) where the middle value is the wpm reading rate. 
Teachers can change this value to the reading rate of their students and after copy and pasting the cell down 
the column, have personalized curriculum time estimates for every academic word in this study. The target 
number of encounters can also be altered by changing the initial value in the function (e.g.,  
[=12/G2*1000000]) which computes curriculum time for 12 repetitions. 
Methodology 
To represent the vocabulary input possible from ER, this study built a larger corpus than previous studies 
(Cobb, 2007; McQuillan, 2019; Nation, 2014), representing the construct as a virtual library of books from 
which students might choose, and for EV a wide variety of television and movies. The corpora were 
designed to be an extensive sample, so as to be consistent with an ER/EV approach that emphasizes self-
selection and putting down any book (or changing the channel) if the material is uninteresting or too difficult 
(Krashen, 2004). The self-selection component of extensive reading is important as it is a mechanism that 
allows students to navigate through authentic materials that are compelling and comprehensible. If students 
are encouraged to put down what they do not enjoy and do not comprehend, then as McQuillan (2016) 
shows, authentic fiction provides ‘pathways’ for students with smaller vocabularies to choose books at their 
level and progress over time to books where a larger vocabulary would be needed. Essential to this ER 
approach is that students have access to a wide range of books (Krashen, 2020). The large corpus of fiction 
books sampled in the current study was designed to represent this construct of a ‘library’ of options. 
From the Corpus of Contemporary American English/COCA (Davies, 2010), the 5407 first chapters of 
novels representing its general fiction component were extracted using some ad-hoc python code. The titles 
of all novels are available in the supplementary materials here1. These titles suggest alignment with the 
principle of pleasure reading (e.g., The Da Vinci Code, Diary of a South Beach Party Girl rather than more 
‘high-brow’ literature). The data constituted 21,226,768 words, henceforth referred to as the ER Corpus. 
An EV Corpus was also developed from COCA constituting 33,045,952 words from 369 movies, 2726 Fox 
and 5877 CNN television broadcasts. This EV corpus represented a wide-range of genres and program 
types, including Point Break, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Mission Impossible, Fox News, Hannity, and CNN 
Showbiz. All titles included in the EV corpus are available in the supplementary materials here.  
Corpora were lemmatized using the Natural Language Toolkit/NLTK (Bird et al., 2009). Frequency lists 
from the corpora were then generated using Wordsmith v7 (Scott, 2017) and matched against the AWL, 
biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics wordlists. For the SVL vocabulary targets, flemmas were 
matched, meaning words with the same form were counted together regardless of part of speech (Dang, 
2020, p. 292). For the AWL, all word family members in the corpora were converted to the AWL headword 
form and then the ER/EV wordlists from Wordsmith matched against AWL headwords. To estimate the 
time needed to encounter target vocabulary at rates potentially sufficient for incidental learning, excel 
functions normed each target’s frequency (per million words), then estimates were computed for the number 
of words of input required for the target number of encounters by dividing 6, 12, 20 by the normed figure 
and multiplying by 1 million. Using these estimates, reading/viewing times in hours were computed based 
on variable wpm input rates of 100, 260, 350 for reading and 80, 140, 200 for viewing, simply by dividing 
the input words by wpm and by 60 (minutes in an hour). 
Results   
This section first reports the results for general academic vocabulary represented by the AWL, and then the 
discipline-specific vocabulary from the SVL.

General Academic Vocabulary: The Academic Word List 
Analysis of the AWL in the ER/EV corpora found all 570 targets attested. This differs from McQuillan 
(2019), whose ER corpus contained only 484/570, likely reflecting his smaller sample. Nevertheless, as 
with McQuillan (2019), what matters is not only attestation but whether the words are encountered at 
frequencies possibly sufficient for incidental learning. Table 1 illustrates the findings with curriculum time 
estimates for some AWL targets at multiple reading rates. The targets in the tables that follow are a few 
selections from amongst the most/least encountered academic vocabulary in ER/EV, as well as examples 
occurring in-between (e.g., approximately 12 times within a year). The complete resource (Appendix A) 
lists all vocabulary and their input/time estimates. The table is to be read as input size (in words), followed 
by time estimates (in hours) for the different wpm rates, as in Table 1. For example, to encounter 
“equivalent” 12 times would take 1.6 m (million) words of input, and 267/102/76 hours at reading rates of 
100/260/350 wpm respectively. 
Table 1 shows AWL vocabulary such as “found,” “final,” “job,” “couple” and “respond” have a high 
possibility of incidental learning as they are easily available in ER. For as many as 20 encounters, a student 
reading at 260 wpm would only need approximately 10 hours of reading or less. Given this information, a 
teacher may decide to use ER for this vocabulary. On the other hand, Table 1 shows that words unlikely to 
be learned through ER, given the time and input required, include “empirical,” “concurrent,” “aggregate,” 
and “qualitative.” Yet, reflected in Table 1 is that for even the slowest reading rate, 20 encounters of words 
such as “ethic,” “equivalent,” “statistic,” “subsequent,” and “amend” could be achieved with 45 minutes of 
reading over 6 to 18 months. A significant overall result (Appendix A) is that with 45 minutes of ER over 
three years, 562 of 570 AWL words would be met at least 12 times by students reading about 260 wpm, 
equivalent to 98.5% of the AWL. Even if the probability of acquisition is a proportion of this, such findings 
are promising for the potential for ER to carry some of the pedagogical burden of providing academic 
vocabulary.  
The AWL results from the EV corpus are reported in Table 2. Table 2 indicates EV provides a significant 
number of AWL encounters within reasonable timeframes. For example, “job,” “issue,” and “economy” 
are encountered multiple times within a matter of hours, and vocabulary such as “protocol,” “external,” and 
“confine” would all be encountered at least 12 times within a year of less than an hour of EV per day, at all 
but the slowest input rate. Supposing students watched one hour per day, overall results suggest that within 
one year students would meet 557/570 AWL words at least six times at the average input rate of 140 wpm–
an impressive 97.7%. Estimating for the slowest input rate (80 wpm) after one year, approximately 432 
(75.8%) of the AWL would have been encountered 20 times, including “contrary,” “flexible,” “scheme,” 
“discrete,” “diminish,” and “parallel.” This leaves only 138 AWL words a teacher may need to target 
through alternative pedagogies, such as those in final row of Table 2 (e.g., “concurrent,” “empirical,” 
“paradigm,” and “interval”).

Discipline-Specific Academic Vocabulary: Biology 
The SVL contains 857 biology words, of which 680 were attested in the ER corpus and 683 in the EV 
corpus. The substantial majority of the SVL: biology (79-80%) is therefore present in ER/EV, though in 
comparison with the AWL, biology vocabulary seems less available, with 177 targets unattested. Unattested 
vocabulary include “homozygous,” “genotype,” “cytoplasm,” and “chromatid” (the complete list for all 
subjects is provided here). For attested vocabulary, Table 3 reports selected examples of curriculum time 
estimates.

Table 3 indicates biology-relevant vocabulary such as “eye,” “body,” “hair” are easily available from ER, 
while vocabulary less available includes “homologous,” “hydrostatic,” “lumen,” with estimates of 
approximately 73 years of reading at 45 minutes a day needed to meet them 6 times for a slow reader. 
However, vocabulary encountered at least 12 times a year with 45 minutes a day of reading at input rates 
above 100 wpm include “syndrome,” “stamen,” “modify,” “stimulate.” Even for a slow reader at 100 wpm, 
overall results are that 45 minutes of ER a day could provide 12 encounters with up to 243 biology targets 
within a year, 319 after two, and 365 after three. Reading at 260 wpm, estimates are 336 words after one 
year, 419 after two, 464 after three; and for faster readers at 350 wpm, 387 words after one year, 454 after 
two, and 493 after three. Thus, for all reading rates, 47 to 57% of the target biology vocabulary might with 
some confidence be targeted within one to three years through ER. Table 4 illustrates the findings for EV.

Table 4 shows that the words “eye,” “inside,” and “wall” are likely to be acquired through EV (if not already 
known) with at least 20 encounters at all input rates achieved within 15 hours. Vocabulary such as “artery,” 
“modify,” “embryonic,” “muscular” also appear good candidates for EV, occurring from 6–20 times at all 
input rates within one to three years of one hour a day of viewing. Given the time and input estimates, 
words unlikely to be acquired include “phenotype,” “mitotic,” “homeostasis” and so forth. Overall results 
indicate that with input at 140 wpm, targeting 12 encounters, after one year of one hour a day, up to 299 
biology-relevant vocabulary may have been encountered enough to be incidentally learned. These include 
“evolution,” “fetal,” “protein,” “nutrition”; after two years, up to  373 words, including “testosterone,” 
“pesticide,” “antibiotic,” “marrow” and after three years, up to 423 words including “organism,” “iris,” and 
“toxin.”   
Discipline-Specific Academic Vocabulary: Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics 
Given space limitations, results for chemistry, physics and mathematics are summarized together. Readers 
are referred to the complete results and the Appendix for some illustrative tables and examples discussed 
in this section. For chemistry vocabulary, 402 out of 501 were present in the ER corpus, and 396 present in 
the EV corpus. The majority of the chemistry wordlist (79–80%) was therefore in general ER/EV.

Unattested targets outside the scope of ER/EV include technical vocabulary such as “ethane,” 
“stoichiometry.” Appendix A shows other chemistry words unlikely to be acquired through ER, such as 
“oxidation,” “silica,” “valence,” with estimates of 127–254 million words of input needed for 12 encounters 
at 260 wpm. However, results show that planning for 45 minutes a day, 197 chemistry targets would be 
encountered more than 12 times after one year at 260 wpm, including “liberate,” “purity,” “carbon,” 
“vigorous,” growing to 249 targets after two years, and 266 after three. For EV, Appendix B shows that 
words such as “displace,” “collide,” “silicon,” “spontaneous” might be acquirable through EV, as all would 
be encountered at least 20 times within three years at all input rates with one hour of daily viewing. A 
curriculum planned on estimates of 140 wpm and 12 encounters could with some assurance place the first 
169 chemistry words listed in the supplementary tool as having a chance of incidental learning within a 
year, 206 by the second and 231 by the third.  
For physics, both ER/EV contained 496 out of 523 targets, which is 95% of the specialized wordlist. The 
handful of unattested vocabulary include “solenoid,” “voltmeter,” and “diffraction.” Appendix C shows 
other low frequency items that would need supplementary pedagogy, such as “rarefaction,” “oscillation.” 
However, vocabulary such as “compress,” “sensor,” “fundamental,” “sensitivity,” “aerial,” all seem 
possible targets for ER. At 45 minutes reading a day, they would be encountered within one year at least 
12 times at 260 wpm. Within three years, up to 398 physics words (76% of the wordlist) occur more than 
12 times, including “conical,” “sparingly,” “titanium.” Results for EV indicate that at one hour per day, 
vocabulary such as “disc,” “rotate,” “precision,” and “dense,” are reasonable candidates for incidental 
learning. As Appendix D shows, they would be met (with the exception of the slowest input rate) 12 times 
within a year and 20 times within two years. Overall, with one hour of EV a day at input of 140 wpm, 317 
targets would be encountered at least 12 times within one year, 372 within two years, and 381 within three 
years.   
For mathematics, 232 out of 242 (96%) targets were in the ER corpus and 223 out of 242 (92%) in the EV 
corpus. Mathematics vocabulary with a high chance of incidental learning through ER, illustrated in 
Appendix E, include “width,” “intercept,” “radius,” and “acute,” which occur over 20 times within one to 
two years above input rates greater than 100 wpm. With 45 minutes of ER per day at 260 wpm, up to 133 
(55%) of the mathematics wordlist would be encountered at least 20 times within a year, vocabulary 
including “function,” “method,” “sum,” “solution,” “arc,” “index,” and “significant.” After three years, 
estimates reach up to 171 words (70%) more than 20 times, including “integer,” “cosine,” “quadrilateral,” 
“gradient,” and “exponential.” For EV, vocabulary such as “probability,” “domain,” “integration,” “axis,” 
“cone,” and “consecutive” might reasonably be placed under EV. Illustrated in Appendix F, they all occur 
at least 12 times within a year of one hour viewing a day. Up to 135 targets would be encountered at least 
12 times after one year of EV assuming one hour per day at 140 wpm, 151 targets after two years, and 165 
targets after three years.   
General Discussion  
This study estimated the potential for ER and EV to support the incidental learning of the general academic 
vocabulary of the AWL, and the discipline-specific academic vocabulary of the SVL. One hopes this study 
is useful in providing curriculum time estimates for specific academic vocabulary at different input rates 
and repetition thresholds, thereby helping teachers make curriculum planning decisions about which words 
they can with some confidence place under ER or EV pedagogy. Furthermore, the supplementary material 
of this study constitutes a tool in which teachers can enter their students’ reading rates and compute 
personalized curriculum time estimates.  
 One clear and important finding is that ER and EV provide substantial exposure to both general academic 
and discipline-specific vocabulary. This suggests they are valuable pedagogies for supporting academic 
vocabulary development. The study could have potentially found that ER/EV would result in limited 
encounters with academic vocabulary, or that curriculum times to encounter this vocabulary frequently 
enough for possible incidental learning would be unreasonable, but this was not the case. Rather, for the

AWL, it was found that all 570 word families were present in both ER and EV corpora, and within three 
years at an average reading rate of 260 wpm, up to 98.5% of the AWL would have been encountered 12 
times or more. Even at a slower reading rate of 100 wpm, a student reading for 45 minutes a day on average 
over three years would have encountered 529 of 570 (93%) AWL targets at least 12 times.  
This study finds that the AWL is more prevalent in general fiction than the previous estimates of McQuillan 
(2019), likely due its larger corpus. Building on Dang (2019), this study shows that exposure to disciplinary 
vocabulary need not necessarily come from materials related to target disciplines but can be supported with 
pleasure reading/viewing generally. Results consistently indicated that approximately 40-60% of target 
vocabulary from mathematics, chemistry, physics and biology, may have sufficient encounters for 
incidental learning within one to three years of curriculum time. Since neither ER/EV are the only source 
of vocabulary input, additional items with fewer encounters may be also be learnable.  
Being the first large-scale corpus study to simultaneously consider ER and EV, this study can also report 
the new finding that the vocabulary input from EV is not particularly impoverished compared to ER. This 
does not downplay the importance of having students read. Rather, it simply suggests that a direct 
comparison of ER/EV offers comparable overall rates of attested/unattested target vocabulary. For example, 
both ER and EV offered exposure to about 80% of the biology and chemistry wordlists, about 95% for 
physics, though for mathematics ER offered slightly more coverage (96%) than EV (92%). Another 
takeaway from these numbers is that at ER/EV are especially relevant input for physics and math.   
Pedagogical Implications 
Let us explore some suggestions for L2 teachers about how they can use the tool developed by this study. 
This tool is a spreadsheet with embedded functions. It lists input and curriculum time estimates for every 
target word on the AWL/SVL. To provide but one example of its pedagogical value, in the context of the 
principal researcher’s experience as a high-school English/ESL teacher and curriculum coordinator for 
grades 7 to 10, the tool would be useful for long-term curriculum planning. ESL students coming into grade 
7 have a foundational vocabulary but, like monolingual students, transition from a broader middle school 
curriculum to more specialized subjects over the next few years, with their final school years characterized 
by electives aligned with their future plans. If proficiency between grades 7 to 10 in academic/disciplinary 
vocabulary is not achieved, this contributes to students struggling in certain subjects, and influences their 
life-choices because students avoid choosing electives where they lack the confidence to succeed. Because 
this tool tells us which vocabulary has a good chance of coming from ER input within certain timeframes, 
we can help students by planning a curriculum that includes daily pleasure reading from grade 7 onward. 
Teachers might plan for 4 terms x 10 weeks, 45 minutes a day, which would be 150 hours of ER per year. 
Using this timeframe, one looks at the tool and finds that under 150 hours at the average reading rate, 341 
AWL words have at least 12 exposures. It seems reasonable that instruction should support AWL 
vocabulary less likely to be incidentally learned. Vocabulary outside general ER/EV does not mean direct 
instruction is the only alternative.  If a faculty can agree on an ER program all the way from grades 7 to 10, 
the years after this may focus on narrow reading matched to the interest of the students (Krashen, 2020). 
Pre-tertiary foundation L2 teachers more generally can benefit from this tool as it allows them to make 
estimates for their available curriculum time by having students estimate their reading rate in wpm (online 
tools for this being easily available). Following the instructions in the methodology, teachers can enter this 
reading rate into the tool and compute an individual vocabulary profile for each student. This might, for 
example, inform how teachers balance ER and EV for particular students. Consider a student with literacy 
difficulties and who was a slow reader under 100 wpm (perhaps lacking motivation) yet watched input 
above 140 wpm with comprehension and enjoyment. The tool suggests that ER for this student at 45 minutes 
a day would provide less academic vocabulary exposure than one hour of EV per day. Teachers and literacy 
aides may decide based on this information to increase EV relative to ER in a differentiated curriculum for 
this student’s needs.   
When looking at the results of this study, teachers should bear in mind that how words are used in EV/ER

may differ from their use in academic contexts and specialized uses may need alternative instruction. For 
example, from mathematics, “mean” was frequently encountered in ER/EV, as was “work” from physics. 
However, this is somewhat misleading as in the context of mathematics “mean” is a synonym for “average,” 
likely a minor meaning encountered in ER/EV. Similarly, “work” in physics refers to force acting on an 
object. This does not mean that ER/EV cannot sometimes provide specialized meanings, however, such as 
in this example in The Hammer of God by Arthur C Clarke (1993), “it’s moving in a retrograde orbit- that 
is, in the opposite direction to all the planets” (p. 148), from which one could potentially establish a meaning 
for “retrograde” and “orbit.” 
Limitations and Future Research   
No number of encounters guarantees incidental learning (Webb, 2020), only a probability of learning, and 
just because vocabulary is available in fiction does not mean that vocabulary support will not be needed 
during classroom interactions between teachers and students engaged with specific texts. Another issue 
with the results is the spacing issue (Uchihara et al., 2019). Obviously, there is a difference between any 
target numbers of encounters spaced over a month versus over a year. At this stage of ER/EV research, we 
do not know the right equation of time to repetitions so we cannot pass this on to teachers. We do not know, 
for example, whether 12 encounters over a year is too little or sufficient for incidental learning. Future 
research will have to fill this research gap. 
Conclusion 
Curriculum decisions about the academic vocabulary that students need and the most effective pedagogy 
for promoting the acquisition of this vocabulary depend on the profile of any given cohort of students. 
Teachers need to take account of many moderating variables when putting pedagogical research into 
practice, such as the language background of their students, their motivation, age, proficiency, whether they 
are struggling readers, training for professions, or aiming for general functional literacy. Having said that, 
there is a place for research that considers vocabulary curriculum planning more broadly. This current study 
found we may be able to partition out to ER/EV pedagogies some of the learning burden for general and 
discipline-specific academic vocabulary. Since this paper provides evidence that there is enough exposure 
in ER/EV for the potential acquisition of particular academic vocabulary items, we can incorporate this 
information into our curriculum planning for which academic words we might want to target with ER/EV 
and which through alternative pedagogies.
