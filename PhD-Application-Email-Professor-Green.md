## EMAIL DRAFT

**Subject**: PhD Application 2026 Fall - Corpus Linguistics & AI-Assisted Academic Writing (Applicant: [Your Name])

---

Dear Professor Green,

I am writing to express my strong interest in applying for the PhD program in the Faculty of Education at the University of Hong Kong for Fall 2026, with the hope of working under your supervision. I have followed your research with great admiration, particularly your recent publications on corpus-based approaches to vocabulary acquisition (Green, 2022a, 2022b) and your systematic review on genre theory and systemic functional linguistics (Green, Giblin, & Mulder, 2024). Your work exemplifies the rigorous, methodologically sophisticated research I aspire to contribute to as a doctoral scholar.

**Research Alignment with Your Expertise**

My proposed research investigates **authorial voice construction in linguistics PhD theses: comparing human-authored and AI-generated academic texts through corpus-based discourse analysis**. This project aligns directly with your research program in three key areas:

1. **Corpus Linguistics Methodology**: Your innovative computational modeling approach to extensive reading research (Green, 2022b) demonstrates how large-scale corpus analysis can address practical pedagogical questions. I aim to apply similar corpus-based methods to examine stance markers, metadiscourse, and lexical bundles in doctoral writing—a natural extension of corpus linguistics into the emerging domain of AI-mediated academic discourse.

2. **Academic Vocabulary and Disciplinary Literacy**: Your work on discipline-specific vocabulary lists and academic wordlist coverage (Green & Lambert, 2018; Green, 2020, 2022a) provides an essential foundation for my research. Understanding how disciplinary vocabulary functions in authentic academic genres is crucial for examining whether AI-generated thesis chapters can replicate the sophisticated lexical and rhetorical patterns of expert scholarly writing.

3. **Evidence-Based Pedagogy and Systematic Research**: Your systematic narrative synthesis review on genre theory/SFL (Green et al., 2024) demonstrates your commitment to rigorous evaluation of educational practices. My proposed research similarly seeks to provide empirical evidence for doctoral writing pedagogy, addressing urgent questions about AI's role in academic authorship—a topic with significant implications for higher education policy and practice.

**My Research Background**

[**Customize this section with your actual background:**]

I hold an [MA/Master's degree] in [Your Field] from [Your University], where my thesis examined [brief description]. My research training includes [mention relevant skills: corpus linguistics tools, statistical analysis, discourse analysis, etc.]. I have [X years] of experience in [teaching/research context], which has deepened my understanding of the challenges facing doctoral writers, particularly English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students navigating complex academic genres.

**Proposed Research Contribution**

My study will compile a parallel corpus of 25-30 linguistics PhD theses (following the precedent of Işık-Taş, 2008; cf. Charles, 2003) comparing human-authored Introduction and Discussion chapters with customized AI-generated equivalents. Using Hyland's (2005, 2008) framework of stance and engagement—combined with Ivanič's (1998) model of writer identity—I will conduct quantitative corpus analysis (frequency distributions, keyness analysis, collocations) alongside qualitative discourse interpretation to examine how authorial voice is linguistically constructed.

This research addresses a critical gap: while studies have compared generic AI-generated texts to human writing (Berber Sardinha, 2024; Amirjalili et al., 2024), **no research has examined customized AI support designed specifically for doctoral writing in a particular discipline**. Given your expertise in corpus methodology and your recent move to the University of Hong Kong, I believe this project would contribute meaningfully to both the theoretical understanding of academic discourse and the practical development of responsible AI-assisted writing pedagogy for multilingual doctoral students.

**Why University of Hong Kong and Why Your Supervision**

The University of Hong Kong's Faculty of Education is internationally recognized for excellence in applied linguistics and language education research. Your presence brings cutting-edge corpus linguistics expertise to an institution with strong traditions in both English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and research on multilingual academic writing. Hong Kong's unique linguistic context—as a hub for Asian doctoral students writing in English—provides an ideal environment for research on academic writing and AI literacy.

Working under your supervision would provide invaluable opportunities to:
- Learn advanced corpus linguistics methodologies and computational modeling techniques you have developed
- Engage with your research network in vocabulary acquisition, extensive reading/viewing, and evidence-based literacy practices
- Contribute to ongoing debates about comprehensible input, incidental learning, and the role of authentic versus simplified materials in language development—themes that parallel questions about authentic versus AI-mediated academic writing
- Develop rigorous systematic review skills exemplified in your 2024 Australian Journal of Language and Literacy publication

**My Commitment and Preparation**

I am fully committed to producing high-quality, publishable research. I have already:
- Compiled a comprehensive literature review on authorial voice, AI-generated academic writing, and corpus-based doctoral writing studies
- Developed a detailed research proposal with sample size justification based on corpus linguistics precedents (including your methodological approaches)
- Identified specific technical requirements (AntConc, SketchEngine, statistical analysis tools) and begun familiarizing myself with these platforms

I am prepared to dedicate myself fully to this doctoral program and contribute to your research group through teaching assistance, presentations, and collaborative projects.

**Application Materials**

I would be honored if you would consider supervising my doctoral research. I am happy to provide:
- Complete research proposal (with detailed methodology and timeline)
- Academic transcripts and degree certificates
- Writing samples and publications (if applicable)
- Letters of recommendation
- Any additional materials you require

I would deeply appreciate the opportunity to discuss my proposed research with you, either via email or video call at your convenience. I am also open to refining my research focus based on your current priorities and expertise.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your research program and the vibrant scholarly community at HKU.

Respectfully yours,

[Your Full Name]  
[Your Current Institution/Position]  
[Your Email Address]  
[Your Phone Number]  
[LinkedIn Profile / Academic Website, if applicable]
