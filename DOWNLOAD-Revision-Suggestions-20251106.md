---

## Part I: Citation Accuracy and Literature Alignment

### ✅ **CORRECTLY CITED VIEWPOINTS**

#### 1. **Hyland's Stance and Engagement Framework**
- **Your claim:** "Hyland's (2005) framework of stance and engagement provides a widely adopted model..."
- **Literature verification:** ✅ **ACCURATE** 
- **Evidence:** The original Hyland (2005) paper confirms the framework distinguishes between stance markers (hedges, boosters, attitude markers, self-mentions) and engagement markers (reader pronouns, directives, questions). Your description aligns perfectly with the source.

#### 2. **Tang and John (1999) on Academic Voice**
- **Your claim:** "Tang and John (1999) demonstrated that even seemingly impersonal student essays reveal layers of self-positioning through the strategic use of first-person pronouns. They proposed a typology of 'selves' behind I, including the representative, guide, and architect..."
- **Literature verification:** ✅ **ACCURATE**
- **Evidence:** This accurately reflects their work on authorial identity in academic writing.

#### 3. **Charles (2003) on Stance Construction**
- **Your claim:** "Charles (2003) analyzed doctoral theses in two disciplines and found that stance is often constructed not merely through modality or evaluation but also through nominal structures—particularly retrospective labels such as This problem or This mystery."
- **Literature verification:** ✅ **ACCURATE**
- **Evidence:** Your literature collection confirms Charles (2003) examined 'This mystery...' and other retrospective labeling in thesis construction.

#### 4. **AI Detection Studies**
- **Your claim:** "Desaire et al. (2023) demonstrated that even accessible machine-learning tools could distinguish ChatGPT writing from human science prose with over 99% accuracy..."
- **Literature verification:** ✅ **ACCURATE**
- **Evidence:** Literature confirms this finding about detection accuracy using machine learning tools.

### ❌ **CITATION ISSUES REQUIRING CORRECTION**

#### 1. **Missing Date in Kasneci Citation**
- **Your text:** "Kasneci et al., n.d."
- **Issue:** You cite this as "n.d." (no date) but reference it in context of current ChatGPT research
- **Correction needed:** Verify and provide proper publication year

#### 2. **Unclear Reference: "(????)"**
- **Your text:** "contributions to the ongoing debate surrounding authorship and agency in AI-assisted writing (????)"
- **Issue:** Missing citation with question marks
- **Action required:** Insert proper citation or remove

#### 3. **Inconsistent Citation Format**
- **Issue:** Some citations use periods in "et al." while others don't
- **Action required:** Standardize citation format throughout

---

## Part II: Methodological Analysis and Concerns

### 🔶 **METHODOLOGICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED**

#### 1. **Corpus Size Justification**
- **Issue:** You propose "25-30 linguistics PhD theses" but don't justify this sample size
- **Literature evidence:** Bao & Liu (2022) used 700 dissertation abstracts each for Chinese and American students
- **Recommendation:** Either justify your smaller sample size or increase it. Explain statistical power considerations.

#### 2. **AI Text Generation Methodology**
- **Your plan:** Generate AI texts using "title, abstract, and research questions as input prompts"
- **Potential issue:** This may not produce comparable texts to full human-authored chapters
- **Literature insight:** Kabir et al. (2025) show that customized GPTs require extensive prompt engineering for discipline-specific outputs
- **Recommendation:** Provide more detailed prompt engineering methodology and validation procedures

#### 3. **Missing Cross-Linguistic Considerations**
- **Gap:** You don't address whether your participants are native English speakers
- **Literature evidence:** Bao & Liu (2022) and other corpus studies show significant differences between L1 and L2 English writers in stance construction
- **Recommendation:** Specify L1 background of participants and consider this as a variable

### 🔶 **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS CONCERNS**

#### 1. **Statistical Tests Mentioned**
- **Your plan:** "chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney U tests"
- **Issue:** No justification for choice of tests or discussion of assumptions
- **Recommendation:** Explain why these specific tests are appropriate for your data type and distribution

#### 2. **Missing Power Analysis**
- **Gap:** No discussion of statistical power or effect size expectations
- **Recommendation:** Include power analysis to justify sample size

---

## Part III: Theoretical Framework Enhancement

### 🔶 **THEORETICAL GAPS TO ADDRESS**

#### 1. **Ivanič's Framework Application**
- **Current usage:** You mention Ivanič (1998) but don't fully integrate her framework
- **Literature evidence:** Multiple papers in your collection use her "discoursal self" and "authorial self" concepts more extensively
- **Recommendation:** Provide more detailed explanation of how you'll operationalize these concepts in your analysis

#### 2. **Hybrid Authorship Theory**
- **Current status:** You mention "hybrid authorship" but don't theoretically ground it
- **Gap:** Limited engagement with authorship theory in AI-mediated writing
- **Recommendation:** Develop a more robust theoretical framework for human-AI collaboration in academic writing

---

## Part IV: Literature Review Enhancements

### ✅ **WELL-COVERED AREAS**
1. Corpus-based studies of academic writing
2. Stance and engagement research
3. AI in education systematic reviews
4. Cross-cultural academic writing studies

### 🔶 **AREAS NEEDING EXPANSION**

#### 1. **Detection Studies**
- **Current coverage:** Basic mention of AI detection tools
- **Literature evidence:** Your collection includes extensive research on AI detection (GPTZero, Quillbot, etc.) with specific accuracy rates
- **Recommendation:** Expand discussion of detection methodologies and their relevance to your study

#### 2. **Pedagogical Implications**
- **Current coverage:** Brief mention in contributions section
- **Literature evidence:** Multiple papers discuss educational applications and concerns
- **Recommendation:** Expand section on pedagogical implications for doctoral writing instruction

#### 3. **Ethical Considerations**
- **Current coverage:** Minimal discussion
- **Literature evidence:** Extensive coverage in your collection about authorship integrity, responsibility, and disclosure
- **Recommendation:** Add substantial section on ethical considerations of AI-assisted thesis writing

---

## Part V: Specific Literature Integration Opportunities

### 1. **Incorporate Recent Findings on Lexical Bundles**
- **Source:** Bao & Liu (2022) in your collection
- **Finding:** "Chinese students are advised to use these bundles by substituting authorial I with names of research, chapters, or sections"
- **Application:** This directly relates to your research on authorial voice construction

### 2. **Leverage AI Writing Quality Studies**
- **Source:** Revell et al. (2024) in your collection
- **Finding:** "Human writers displayed greater interpretive depth, contextual awareness, and stylistic variability"
- **Application:** Supports your research premise about differences in authorial voice

### 3. **Address Cultural Dimensions**
- **Source:** Multiple papers on Chinese vs. American academic writing in your collection
- **Application:** Consider cultural factors in AI-assisted authorial voice construction

---

## Part VI: Methodological Recommendations

### 1. **Enhanced Corpus Design**
```
Recommended Structure:
- Human Corpus: 50-100 PhD thesis chapters (Introduction/Discussion)
- AI Corpus: Parallel AI-generated versions using structured prompts
- Control variables: L1 background, discipline, thesis year
- Size justification: Power analysis for planned statistical tests
```

### 2. **Improved Prompt Engineering Protocol**
```
Suggested Framework:
1. Initial prompts based on thesis metadata
2. Iterative refinement based on human feedback
3. Validation through expert evaluation
4. Documentation of all prompt variations
5. Quality control measures
```

### 3. **Multi-layered Analysis Approach**
```
Proposed Analysis Levels:
1. Quantitative corpus analysis (frequencies, distributions)
2. Qualitative discourse analysis (stance construction patterns)
3. Expert evaluation (disciplinary voice assessment)
4. Statistical validation (significance testing)
```
